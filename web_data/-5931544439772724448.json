        "publishedDate": "2024-04-12T16:30:15",
        "content": "In recent years, we have seen many advancements in wood species identification. Methods like DNA analysis, Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, and Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART) mass spectrometry complement the long-established wood anatomical assessment of cell and tissue morphology. However, most of these methods have some limitations such as high costs, the need for skilled experts for data interpretation, and the lack of good datasets for professional reference. Therefore, most of these methods, and certainly the wood anatomical assessment, may benefit from tools based on Artificial Intelligence. In this paper, we apply two transfer learning techniques with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to a multi-view Congolese wood species dataset including sections from different orientations and viewed at different microscopic magnifications. We explore two feature extraction methods in detail, namely Global Average Pooling (GAP) and Random Encoding of Aggregated Deep Activation Maps (RADAM), for efficient and accurate wood species identification. Our results indicate superior accuracy on diverse datasets and anatomical sections, surpassing the results of other methods. Our proposal represents a significant advancement in wood species identification, offering a robust tool to support the conservation of forest ecosystems and promote sustainable forestry practices.",

        "content": "Computer vision systems for wood identification have the potential to empower both producer and consumer countries to combat illegal logging if they can be deployed effectively in the field. In this work, carried out as part of an active international partnership with the support of UNIDO, we constructed and curated a field-relevant image data set to train a classifier for wood identification of $15$ commercial Ghanaian woods using the XyloTron system. We tested model performance in the laboratory, and then collected real-world field performance data across multiple sites using multiple XyloTron devices. We present efficacies of the trained model in the laboratory and in the field, discuss practical implications and challenges of deploying machine learning wood identification models, and conclude that field testing is a necessary step - and should be considered the gold-standard - for validating computer vision wood identification systems.",

        "publishedDate": "2022-09-26T19:34:42",
        "content": "This study investigates the prospect of using reduced graphene oxide encapsulated between thin wood membranes as a composite filter for water filtration. Graphene oxide (GO) with a volume range of 0.2 to 0.5 mL was deposited on a 95 mm2 area of thin sheets of Balsa wood with a thickness range of 2.20 - 3.50 mm. The dried GO deposits were laser treated in reduced oxygen environment to prepare a reduced graphene oxide-wood composite (rGO-wood). The rGO substrate of the composite was sandwiched between 2 wood sheets which were glued using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to give a stable membrane. Fabricated membranes improved the Allura red rejection from 8.29 $\\pm$ 0.69% in the controls (sandwiched wood sheets without rGO) to 93.14 $\\pm$ 1.31% in the 1 mL total rGO composites. The ratio of percentage permeance drop of the treatments over the controls ranged from 62.8 $\\pm$ 4.3 to 85.4 $\\pm$ 5.2% from the 0.4 to 1 mL rGO composites respectively. The correlation coefficient (r) between the GO volume and rejection was 0.94 suggesting that the GO treatments provided some control over the transport of molecules through the membrane. The correlation coefficient between wood thickness, and Allura red rejection shows that the wood sheets did not influence the rejection. The permeance was weakly affected by the membrane thickness (r = -0.46). An 93% improvement in rejection performance of the composite membranes over the controls was observed. The overall data suggests that the wood-rGO composite has potential for water filtration applications.",

        "content": "The optical response of hierarchical materials is convoluted, which hinders their direct study and property control. Transparent wood (TW) is an emerging biocomposite in this category, which adds optical function to the structural properties of wood. Nano- and microscale inhomogeneities in composition, structure and at interfaces strongly affect light transmission and haze. While interface manipulation can tailor TW properties, the realization of optically clear wood requires detailed understanding of light-TW interaction mechanisms. Here we show how material scattering and absorption coefficients can be extracted from a combination of experimental spectroscopic measurements and a photon diffusion model. Contributions from different length scales can thus be deciphered and quantified. It is shown that forward scattering dominates haze in TW, primarily caused by refractive index mismatch between the wood substrate and the polymer phase. Rayleigh scattering from the wood cell wall and absorption from residual lignin have minor effects on transmittance, but the former affects haze. Results provide guidance for material design of transparent hierarchical composites towards desired optical functionality; we demonstrate experimentally how transmittance and haze of TW can be controlled over a broad range.",

        "content": "With the rise in wood stove use in recent years, a number of experimental research efforts have been undertaken with the objective of developing cleaner, and more efficient stove designs. However, numerical modeling of stoves is still in its nascent years, thus making it imperative to start adapting more mature computational techniques, established in other combustion-based applications (e.g., combustion engines), to wood stoves. This study focuses on a critical review of the state-of-the-art in wood combustion modeling techniques and on providing recommendations for needed enhancements. In order to develop an optimum conceptual numerical model for wood stoves, the basic processes inside the stove are broken down and isolated into generic computational domains: surface reactions, gas reactions, and the fluid domain. Then state-of-the-art numerical efforts for wood stove and similar applications are broken down in a similar manner to highlight points of strength and possible improvements. Finally, based on the comparison between the different models, an improved modeling approach is proposed as a road map for future research efforts to achieve a higher fidelity wood stove numerical model.",

        "content": "Traditionally source identification is solved using threshold based energy detection algorithms. These algorithms frequently sum up the activity in regions, and consider regions above a specific activity threshold to be sources. While these algorithms work for the majority of cases, they often fail to detect signals that occupy small frequency bands, fail to distinguish sources with overlapping frequency bands, and cannot detect any signals under a specified signal to noise ratio. Through the conversion of raw signal data to spectrogram, source identification can be framed as an object detection problem. By leveraging modern advancements in deep learning based object detection, we propose a system that manages to alleviate the failure cases encountered when using traditional source identification algorithms. Our contributions include framing source identification as an object detection problem, the publication of a spectrogram object detection dataset, and evaluation of the RetinaNet and YOLOv5 object detection models trained on the dataset. Our final models achieve Mean Average Precisions of up to 0.906. With such a high Mean Average Precision, these models are sufficiently robust for use in real world applications.",

        "publishedDate": "2017-04-04T13:53:16",
        "content": "This work presents an efficient method for evaluation of wave scattering by doubly periodic diffraction gratings at or near \"Wood anomaly frequencies\". At these frequencies, one or more grazing Rayleigh waves exist, and the lattice sum for the quasi-periodic Green function ceases to exist. We present a modification of this sum by adding two types of terms to it. The first type adds linear combinations of \"shifted\" Green functions, ensuring that the spatial singularities introduced by these terms are located below the grating and therefore outside of the physical domain. With suitable coefficient choices these terms annihilate the growing contributions in the original lattice sum and yield algebraic convergence. Convergence of arbitrarily high order can be obtained by including sufficiently many shifts. The second type of added terms are quasi-periodic plane wave solutions of the Helmholtz equation which reinstate certain necessary grazing modes without leading to blow-up at Wood anomalies. Using the new quasi-periodic Green function, we establish, for the first time, that the Dirichlet problem of scattering by a smooth doubly periodic scattering surface at a Wood frequency is uniquely solvable. We also present an efficient high-order numerical method based on the this new Green function for the problem of scattering by doubly periodic three-dimensional surfaces at and around Wood frequencies. We believe this is the first solver in existence that is applicable to Wood-frequency doubly periodic scattering problems. We demonstrate the proposed approach by means of applications to problems of acoustic scattering by doubly periodic gratings at various frequencies, including frequencies away from, at, and near Wood anomalies.",

Wood is a byproduct of several states, ranging from standing trees to logs, lumber, and wood products (hereinafter ``wood objects''). The advantage of using the blockchain for record keeping is that participants can freely record the information at their discretion, without any restrictions. However, the openness of the blockchain may allow a malicious third party to introduce disinformation. In this study, we employ ZKP and near-field communication (NFC) chips to eliminate the possibility of disinformation introduction. ZKP is used to prove/validate changes in the state of wood objects, and the unique nonce associated with that state is encrypted and recorded on an NFC chip. The nonce is concealed and id of the wood object is defined as hash value of this nonce. We developed a prototype system based on an Android application and an Ethereum smart contract. We confirm that wood traceability and verification can be performed using the prototype system.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-09-07T22:03:13",
        "content": "Quick and reliable measurement of wood chip moisture content is an everlasting problem for numerous forest-reliant industries such as biofuel, pulp and paper, and bio-refineries. Moisture content is a critical attribute of wood chips due to its direct relationship with the final product quality. Conventional techniques for determining moisture content, such as oven-drying, possess some drawbacks in terms of their time-consuming nature, potential sample damage, and lack of real-time feasibility. Furthermore, alternative techniques, including NIR spectroscopy, electrical capacitance, X-rays, and microwaves, have demonstrated potential; nevertheless, they are still constrained by issues related to portability, precision, and the expense of the required equipment. Hence, there is a need for a moisture content determination method that is instant, portable, non-destructive, inexpensive, and precise. This study explores the use of deep learning and machine vision to predict moisture content classes from RGB images of wood chips. A large-scale image dataset comprising 1,600 RGB images of wood chips has been collected and annotated with ground truth labels, utilizing the results of the oven-drying technique. Two high-performing neural networks, MoistNetLite and MoistNetMax, have been developed leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and hyperparameter optimization. The developed models are evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art deep learning models. Results demonstrate that MoistNetLite achieves 87% accuracy with minimal computational overhead, while MoistNetMax exhibits exceptional precision with a 91% accuracy in wood chip moisture content class prediction. With improved accuracy and faster prediction speed, our proposed MoistNet models hold great promise for the wood chip processing industry.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-11-28T16:03:22",
        "content": "Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), a nuanced task in text analysis, seeks to discern sentiment orientation linked to specific aspect terms in text. Traditional approaches often overlook or inadequately model the explicit syntactic structures of sentences, crucial for effective aspect term identification and sentiment determination. Addressing this gap, we introduce an innovative model: Syntactic Dependency Enhanced Multi-Task Interaction Architecture (SDEMTIA) for comprehensive ABSA. Our approach innovatively exploits syntactic knowledge (dependency relations and types) using a specialized Syntactic Dependency Embedded Interactive Network (SDEIN). We also incorporate a novel and efficient message-passing mechanism within a multi-task learning framework to bolster learning efficacy. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets showcase our model's superiority, significantly surpassing existing methods. Additionally, incorporating BERT as an auxiliary feature extractor further enhances our model's performance.",

        "content": "Previous studies on the modification of fast-growing wood have extensively examined the effects of density and lignin content on the strength and high-temperature properties of modified wood. However, a comprehensive quantitative analysis of their effects on high-temperature performance remains insufficient. To address this knowledge gap, we applied alkali treatment and compression densification to fast-growing poplar, resulting in modified specimens with varying densities and lignin levels. The quantitative effects of density and lignin content on high-temperature properties were meticulously evaluated. Chemical changes were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), while the mechanical and high-temperature properties were comprehensively assessed. Delignification was found to be positively correlated with treatment duration, with hemicellulose degradation also detected via FT-IR analysis. Significant enhancements were recorded in flexural strength, tensile strength, and modulus of elasticity, accompanied by improvements in ductility ratio and compressive strength. The modified poplar wood exhibited increased thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, density and lignin content were identified as significant factors affecting high-temperature performance, establishing minimum density thresholds for various lignin contents in modified poplar wood to ensure optimal performance. This study enhances to the understanding of the intricate relationships among wood properties, modification techniques, and high-temperature performance.",

        "content": "Renewable feedstocks are sought for clean technology applications, including energy storage applications. In this study, LignoForce™ lignin, a biobased aromatic polymer commercially isolated from wood, was fractioned into two parts using acetone, and the resulting lignin fractions had distinct thermo-rheological behavior. These two fractionated lignins were combined in various ratios and transformed into nanofibers by electrospinning. Subsequently, electrospun fiber materials were disrupted by agitating the mats in water, and the materials were transformed into ultralight 3D aerogels through lyophilization and post-process controlled heating. Using only this combination of two fractions, the morphology of lignin nanofibers was tailored by heat treatment, resulting in lignin aerogels with high flexibility and significant shape recovery properties. Various microscale structures of lignin fibers impacted the resulting physical properties of the elastic aerogel materials, such as resilience, compressive strength, and electrical conductivity for the corresponding carbonized samples. By exploiting lignin's sensitivity to heat and tailoring the thermal properties of the lignin through fractionation, the work provided an interesting path to form robust lignin-derived functional materials without any toxic chemical additives and significant ability to serve as free-standing electrodes with specific capacitance values better than some graphene-based supercapacitors.",

To date, however, most data-driven approaches have focused on the prediction of scalar crystal properties, such as the spherically averaged dielectric tensor or the bulk and shear elastic moduli.

        "title": "Optimizing paper sludge content and particle size to enhance particleboard properties.",
        "content": "The pulp and paper industry generates vast quantities of paper sludge, posing significant environmental challenges due to its disposal in landfills or incineration. This study explores the potential of valorizing paper sludge by incorporating it into particleboard production. It aims to optimize sludge content and particle size to enhance board properties-a novel approach to waste management in the wood composites industry. Through systematic variation of sludge content (0-25%) and particle size (< 0.5 to > 2 mm), we assessed the mechanical and physical properties such as internal bond strength (IB), modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), water absorption (WA), and thickness swelling (TS). The findings indicate that incorporating paper sludge at moderate levels (5-15%) with optimized particle sizes (< 1 mm) significantly improves the mechanical properties of the particleboard, including increased IB, MOR, and MOE while reducing WA and TS. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) further supported these results, revealing that higher-density boards with enhanced mechanical properties absorb less water, highlighting the interrelationship between structural integrity and moisture resistance. The PCA also identified thickness swelling as an independent factor, suggesting that while mechanical properties can be optimized, additional strategies are needed to control swelling. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that up to 15% paper sludge can be effectively used in particleboard production without compromising quality, provided particle size is carefully controlled. This approach not only offers a sustainable solution for managing paper sludge but also contributes to the development of eco-friendly composite materials, aligning with circular economy principles.",

        "content": "As a mature non-destructive testing technology, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy can effectively identify and distinguish the structural characteristics of wood. The Wood Defect One-Dimensional Visual Geometry Group 19-Finite Element Analysis (WD-1D-VGG19-FEA) algorithm is used in this study. 1D-VGG19 classifies the near-infrared spectroscopy data to determine the knot area, fiber deviation area, transition area, and net wood area of the solid wood board surface and generates a two-dimensional image of the board surface through inversion. Then, the nonlinear three-dimensional model of wood with defects was established by using the inverse image, and the finite element analysis was carried out to predict the elastic modulus of wood. In the experiment, 270 points were selected from each of the four regions of the wood, totaling 1080 sets of near-infrared data, and the 1D-VGG19 model was used for classification. The results showed that the identification accuracy of the knot area was 95.1%, the fiber deviation area was 92.7%, the transition area was 90.2%, the net wood area was 100%, and the average accuracy was 94.5%. The error range of the elastic modulus prediction of the three-dimensional model established by the VGG19 classification model in the finite element analysis is between 2% and 10%, the root mean square error (RMSE) is about 598. 2, and the coefficient of determination (R2) is 0. 91. This study shows that the combination of the VGG19 algorithm and finite element analysis can accurately describe the nonlinear defect morphology of wood, thus establishing a more accurate prediction model of wood mechanical properties to maximize the use of wood mechanical properties.",

        "content": "The aim of the study was to identify limiting factors for reusing wood through the recycling of window frames by conducting research under fully controlled conditions. The research involved manufacturing new window frames, seasoning them, and then shredding them into wood particles to prepare a three-layer particleboard. The proportion of wood particles in recycling was 0, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 parts by weight of the manufactured particleboard. Mechanical property tests were conducted: modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR), internal bond (IB), screw withdrawal resistance (SWR), and physical properties: density profile (DP), thickness swelling (TS) after water immersion, water absorption (WA), as well as formaldehyde emission and total volatile organic compound (TVOCs) tests. The research indicates a significant potential for utilizing wood from this sector of the wood industry, particularly considering variants with a higher proportion of recycled wood. MOR and MOE results are most promising for variants above 50 parts by weight of recycled wood. Based on the results obtained, it is clear that the production process should be improved or the raw material modified to enhance the internal bonding of particleboard, as these results were the weakest. Thus, recycled wood from window joinery has the potential to be reincarnated as particleboard, which continues to be widely used in their production.",

        "content": "Nonwoven upholstery fabric is a waste product which is mainly generated during upholstered furniture production. The polyester composition makes it problematic to recycle and reuse this product. This study examined the manufacturing process of nonwoven fabric-reinforced plywood composites and their selected mechanical and physical properties. Nonwoven fabric was integrated between veneers bound with urea-formaldehyde resin to improve standard layered composites' mechanical and physical properties. Several board variants were produced, differing in the position of the nonwoven layers in the composite structure. The composites were evaluated for modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), internal bond, and screw withdrawal resistance, among others. The results showed that the addition of nonwoven fabric significantly improved some properties, like internal bond and screw withdrawal resistance. Variants with strategically placed nonwoven layers showed the highest performance increases. The results underscore the potential of nonwoven fabric as an effective reinforcing material, offering a path to developing high-performance plywood composites suitable for demanding applications. Another environmental advantage is that the nonwoven fabric waste used in the tested plywood production has not been subjected to burning or landfilling but, through its incorporation into plywood structure, has positively contributed to the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) policy. The findings advocate for a circular economy approach, in which industrial waste is effectively repurposed, contributing to the development of green materials in the wood-based composite industry.",

The results illustrates that the incident wave can enhance the resonance response at the redistributed resonance frequency, which leads to an increase in radial acceleration and the secondary Bjerknes force, and rapid approach of bubbles. Furthermore, the influence of incident wave on the interaction of bubbles driven at lower frequencies is more significant, due to resonance enhancement caused by the proximity of natural frequencies and frequency multiplications of the external sound field. Our findings reveal that the compressible effect is not only critical to interaction in radial oscillations, but also in translational motion.",

We study the special case of absence of symmetry induced by a group of scaling transformations of the continuous distribution of frequencies. When coupling between oscillators is increased beyond a critical threshold favoring spontaneous synchronization, we found that the variation in the velocity of the traveling wave depends on the extent of asymmetry in the natural frequency distribution. In particular for large coupling this velocity is the average natural frequency whereas at the onset of synchronization it corresponds to the frequency where the Hilbert Transform of the frequency distribution vanishes.",

The time evolution is generated by N^{2} coupled differential equations for the matrix elements of U, and synchronization happens when U evolves into a multiple of the identity. The Ott-Antonsen ansatz is related to the Poisson kernels that are so useful in quantum transport, and we prove it in the case of identical natural frequencies. When the coupling constant is a matrix, we find some surprising new dynamical behaviors.",

        "content": "Synchronization among rhythmic elements is modeled by coupled phase-oscillators each of which has the so-called natural frequency. A symmetric natural frequency distribution induces a continuous or discontinuous synchronization transition from the nonsynchronized state, for instance. It has been numerically reported that asymmetry in the natural frequency distribution brings new types of bifurcation diagram having, in the order parameter, oscillation or a discontinuous jump which emerges from a partially synchronized state. We propose a theoretical classification method of five types of bifurcation diagrams including the new ones, paying attention to the generality of the theory. The oscillation and the jump from partially synchronized states are discussed respectively by the linear analysis around the nonsynchronized state and by extending the amplitude equation up to the third leading term. The theoretical classification is examined by comparing with numerically obtained one.",

It is well known that for a spring-mass system wherein the adjacent masses are linked through a spring, the natural frequency assignment can be achieved by choosing appropriate masses and spring stiffnesses if and only if the given positive eigenvalues are distinct. However, when we involve inerters, multiple eigenvalues in the assignment are allowed. In fact, arbitrarily given a set of positive real numbers, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition on the multiplicities of these numbers, which are assigned as the natural frequencies of the concerned mass-spring-inerter system.",

        "content": "Modeling the dynamic properties of wood and wood-based composites is a challenging task due to naturally growing structure and moisture-dependent material properties. This paper presents the finite element modeling of plywood panels' dynamic properties. Two panels differing in thickness were analyzed: (i) 18 mm and (ii) 27 mm. The developed models consisted of individual layers of wood, which were discretized using three-dimensional finite elements formulated using an orthotropic material model. The models were subjected to an updating procedure based on experimentally determined frequency response functions. As a result of a model updating relative errors for natural frequencies obtained numerically and experimentally were not exceeding 2.0%, on average 0.7% for 18 mm thick panel and not exceeding 2.6%, on average 1.5% for 27 mm thick panel. To prove the utility of the method and at the same time to validate it, a model of a cabinet was built, which was then subjected to experimental verification. In this case, average relative differences for natural frequencies of 6.6% were obtained.",

        "content": "The structural health monitoring (SHM) of buildings provides relevant data for the evaluation of the structural behavior over time, the efficiency of maintenance, strengthening, and post-earthquake conditions. This paper presents the design and implementation of a continuous SHM system based on dynamic properties, base accelerations, crack widths, out-of-plane rotations, and environmental data for the retrofitted church of Kuñotambo, a 17th century adobe structure, located in the Peruvian Andes. The system produces continuous hourly records. The organization, data collection, and processing of the SHM system follows different approaches and stages, concluding with the assessment of the structural and environmental conditions over time compared to predefined thresholds. The SHM system was implemented in May 2022 and is part of the Seismic Retrofitting Project of the Getty Conservation Institute. The initial results from the first twelve months of monitoring revealed seasonal fluctuations in crack widths, out-of-plane rotations, and natural frequencies, influenced by hygrothermal cycles, and an apparent positive trend, but more data are needed to justify the nature of these actions. This study emphasizes the necessity for extended data collection to establish robust correlations and refine monitoring strategies, aiming to enhance the longevity and safety of historic adobe structures under seismic risk.",

        "content": "A full triangular chiral (Tri-Chi) honeycomb, combining a honeycomb structure with triangular chiral configuration, notably impacts the Poisson's ratio (PR) and stiffness. To assess the random vibration properties of a composite sandwich panel with a Tri-Chi honeycomb core (CSP-TCH), a two-dimensional equivalent Reissner-Mindlin model (2D-ERM) was created using the variational asymptotic method. The precision of the 2D-ERM in free and random vibration analysis was confirmed through numerical simulations employing 3D finite element analysis, encompassing PSD curves and RMS responses. Furthermore, the effects of selecting the model class were quantified through dynamic numerical examples. Modal analysis revealed that the relative error of the first eight natural frequencies predicted by the 2D-ERM consistently remained below 7%, with the modal cloud demonstrating high reliability. The PSD curves and their RMS values closely aligned with 3D finite element results under various boundary conditions, with a maximum error below 5%. Key factors influencing the vibration characteristics included the ligament-rib angle of the core layer and layup modes of the composite facesheets, while the rib-to-ligament thickness ratio and the aspect ratio exert minimal influence. The impact of the ligament-rib angle on the vibration properties primarily stems from the significant shift in the core layer's Poisson's ratio, transitioning from negative to positive. These findings offer a rapid and precise approach for optimizing the vibration design of CSP-TCH.",

        "publishedDate": "2021-06-11T15:59:33",
        "content": "For natural frequency optimization of engineering structures, cellular composites have been shown to possess an edge over solid. However, existing multiscale design methods for cellular composites are either computationally exhaustive or confined to a single class of microstructures. In this paper, we propose a data-driven topology optimization (TO) approach to enable the multiscale design of cellular structures with various choices of microstructure classes. The key component is a newly proposed latent-variable Gaussian process (LVGP) model through which different classes of microstructures are mapped into a low-dimensional continuous latent space. It provides an interpretable distance metric between classes and captures their effects on the homogenized stiffness tensors. By introducing latent vectors as design variables, a differentiable transition of stiffness matrix between classes can be easily achieved with an analytical gradient. After integrating LVGP with the density-based TO, an efficient data-driven cellular composite optimization process is developed to enable concurrent exploration of microstructure concepts and the associated volume fractions for natural frequency optimization. Examples reveal that the proposed cellular designs with multiclass microstructures achieve higher natural frequencies than both single-scale and single-class designs. This framework can be easily extended to other multi-scale TO problems, such as thermal compliance and dynamic response optimization.",

        "content": "In this study, a numerical dynamic analysis of ceiling raster panels was performed. The analysis was conducted on panels designed with inspiration from bionics. The purpose of the analysis was to enable optimisation of the location of the holes in the designed slabs in order to achieve the preferred dynamic properties, including the natural frequencies of the slabs and an appropriate airflow to avoid the occurrence of resonance. Three different types of panels were used and a total of fifteen panels were designed in terms of their geometry, with circular, elliptical, and hexagonal perforations, made of different materials: polypropylene PP, wood, and aluminium. Then, using the finite element method and ANSYS 2023 R1 software, the airflow over the ceiling panels and their natural frequencies and vibration modes were analysed. The analysis took into account not only the shape of the openings, but also their percentage area relative to the total panel area and different airflow velocities. In addition, the results were compared in an analytical way with those obtained for a solid slab. The results obtained include findings on the mode shapes and values of the vibration frequencies of the plates, air pressure maps, histograms, and plots of the pressure dependence on the surface area of the plate openings.",

        "content": "The paper studies the topological changes from before and after cointegration, for the natural frequencies of the Z24 Bridge. The second natural frequency is known to be nonlinear in temperature, and this will serve as the main focal point of this work. Cointegration is a method of normalising time series data with respect to one another - often strongly-correlated time series. Cointegration is used in this paper to remove effects from Environmental and Operational Variations, by cointegrating the first four natural frequencies for the Z24 Bridge data. The temperature effects on the natural frequency data are clearly visible within the data, and it is desirable, for the purposes of structural health monitoring, that these effects are removed. The univariate time series are embedded in higher-dimensional space, such that interesting topologies are formed. Topological data analysis is used to analyse the raw time series, and the cointegrated equivalents. A standard topological data analysis pipeline is enacted, where simplicial complexes are constructed from the embedded point clouds. Topological properties are then calculated from the simplicial complexes; such as the persistent homology. The persistent homology is then analysed, to determine the topological structure of all the time series.",

        "title": "Branch spiral beam harvester for uni-directional ultra-low frequency excitations.",
        "content": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in piezoelectric energy harvesting systems, particularly for their potential to recharge or replace batteries in energy-efficient electronic devices and wireless sensor networks. Nonetheless, the conventional linear piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEH) face limitations in ultra-low frequency vibrations (1-10 Hz) due to their narrow operating bandwidth and higher resonance frequencies. To address this, researchers explored compact shaped geometries, with spiral PEH being one such design to lower resonance frequencies by reducing structural stiffness. While trying to achieve this lower resonance frequency, spiral designs overlooked that they were spreading the stress across the structure. This was a significant drawback because it reduced the structure's ability to stress the piezoelectric transducer. The issue remains unaddressed, limiting the power generation of spiral beam harvesters. Furthermore, spiral structures also fail to broaden the operating bandwidth, posing additional constraints on their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel solution - the \"branch spiral beam harvester,\" combining the benefits of both spiral and branch beam designs. The integration of the branch beam concept into the spiral structure aimed to broaden the effective frequency range and establish a concentrated stress area for the placement of the piezoelectric transducer. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was employed to assess operating bandwidth and stress distribution, while experimental studies evaluated voltage and power generation. Once the workability was confirmed, a statistical optimisation method was introduced to tailor the harvester for specific frequencies in the ultra-low frequency range. Results indicated that the branch spiral beam harvester exhibits a wider operating bandwidth with six natural frequencies in the ultra-low frequency range. It harnessed significantly higher output voltages and power compared to conventional linear PEH. This innovation presents a promising advancement in piezoelectric energy harvesting, offering improved performance without the need for proof masses or additional accessories.",

        "content": "The multidimensional Kuramoto model describes the synchronization dynamics of particles moving on the surface of D-dimensional spheres, generalizing the original model where particles were characterized by a single phase. In this setup, particles are more easily represented by $D$-dimensional unit vectors than by $D-1$ spherical angles, allowing for the coupling constant to be extended to a coupling matrix acting on the vectors. As in the original Kuramoto model, each particle has a set of $D(D-1)/2$ natural frequencies, drawn from a distribution. The system has a large number of independent parameters, given by the average natural frequencies, the characteristic widths of their distributions plus $D^2$ constants of the coupling matrix. General phase diagrams, indicating regions in parameter space where the system exhibits different behaviors, are hard to derive analytically. Here we obtain the complete phase diagram for $D=2$ and Lorentzian distributions of natural frequencies using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz. We also explore the diagrams numerically for different distributions and some specific choices of parameters for $D=2$, $D=3$ and $D=4$. In all cases the system exhibits at most four different phases: disordered, static synchrony, rotation and active synchrony. Existence of specific phases and boundaries between them depend strongly on the dimension $D$, the coupling matrix and the distribution of natural frequencies.",

        "content": "We study synchronization patterns in repulsively coupled Kuramoto oscillators and focus on the impact of disorder in the natural frequencies. Among other choices we select the grid size and topology in a way that we observe a dynamically induced dimensional reduction with a continuum of attractors as long as the natural frequencies are uniformly chosen. When we introduce disorder in these frequencies, we find limit cycles with periods that are orders of magnitude longer than the natural frequencies of individual oscillators. Moreover we identify sequences of temporary patterns of phase-locked motion, which are self-similar in time and whose periods scale with a power of the inverse width about a uniform frequency distribution. This behavior provides challenges for future research.",

Among the post-hoc interpretation methods such as back-propagation, perturbation, and approximation, my work will investigate perturbation-based sensitivity Analysis methods on modern Transformer models to benchmark their performances. Specifically, my work answers three research questions: 1) Do different sensitivity analysis (SA) methods yield comparable outputs and attribute importance rankings? 2) Using the same sensitivity analysis method, do different Deep Learning (DL) models impact the output of the sensitivity analysis? 3) How well do the results from sensitivity analysis methods align with the ground truth?",

        "content": "Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a Class C infectious disease that carries particularly high risk for preschool children and is a leading cause of childhood death in some countries. We mimic the periodic outbreak of HFMD over a 2-year period-with differing amplitudes-and propose a dynamic HFMD model that differentiates transmission between mature and immature individuals and uses two possible optimal-control strategies to minimize case numbers, total costs and deaths. We parameterized the model by fitting it to HFMD data in mainland China from January 2011 to December 2018, and the basic reproduction number was estimated as 0.9599. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that transmission between immature and mature individuals contributes substantially to new infections. Increasing the isolation rates of infectious individuals-particularly mature infectious individuals-could greatly reduce the outbreak risk and potentially eradicate the disease in a relatively short time period. It follows that we have a reasonable chance of controlling HFMD if we can reduce transmission in children under 7 and isolate older infectious individuals.",

This study is a preliminary evaluation of graded exposure therapy (GET), which directly targets fear avoidance behaviour, for reducing post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and disability following mTBI. In a historical comparison design, we compared two groups from independent randomized trials. The GET + UC group (N = 34) received GET (delivered over 16 videoconference sessions) in addition to usual care (UC). The historical comparison group (N = 71) received UC only. PCS severity (Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire; RPQ) and disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule; WHODAS 2.0 12-item) were measured at clinic intake (M = 2.7, SD = 1.1 months after injury) and again at M = 4.9 (SD = 1.1) months after injury. Between-group differences were estimated using linear mixed effects regression, with a sensitivity analysis controlling for injury-to-assessment intervals. The estimated average change on the RPQ was -14.3 in the GET + UC group and -5.3 in the UC group. The estimated average change on the WHODAS was -5.3 in the GET + UC group and -3.2 in the UC group. Between-group differences post-treatment were -5.3 on the RPQ and -1.5 on the WHODAS. Treatment effects were larger in sensitivity analyses. Findings suggest that a randomized controlled trial is warranted.",

For a given counterfactual policy, we obtain identified sets for the effect of both marginal and global changes in the proportion of treated individuals. To conduct a sensitivity analysis, we introduce the quantile breakdown frontier, a curve that (i) indicates whether a sensitivity analysis is possible or not, and (ii) when a sensitivity analysis is possible, quantifies the amount of selection bias consistent with a given conclusion of interest across different quantiles. To illustrate our method, we perform a sensitivity analysis on the effect of unionizing low income workers on the quantiles of the distribution of (log) wages.",

It would be beneficial in various industrial sectors, including semiconductors and automobiles. Our research focused on low-energy plasmas in laboratory settings, and they were assessed via our proposed method, which incorporates relative entropy and fractional Brownian motion, based on a revised collisional-radiative model. By introducing an indicator to evaluate how far a system is from its steady state, both the trend of entropy and the radiative process' contribution to the lifetime of excited states were considered. The high statistical weight of some excited states may act as a bottleneck in the plasma's energy relaxation throughout the system to a steady state. By deepening our understanding of how energy flows through plasmas, we anticipate potential contributions to resolving global environmental issues and fostering technological innovation in plasma-related industrial fields.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-09-12T16:36:22",
        "content": "In matched observational studies, the inferred causal conclusions pretending that matching has taken into account all confounding can be sensitive to unmeasured confounding. In such cases, a sensitivity analysis is often conducted, which investigates whether the observed association between treatment and outcome is due to effects caused by the treatment or it is due to hidden confounding. In general, a sensitivity analysis tries to infer the minimum amount of hidden biases needed in order to explain away the observed association between treatment and outcome, assuming that the treatment has no effect. If the needed bias is large, then the treatment is likely to have significant effects. The Rosenbaum sensitivity analysis is a modern approach for conducting sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies. It investigates what magnitude the maximum of the hidden biases from all matched sets needs to be in order to explain away the observed association, assuming that the treatment has no effect. However, such a sensitivity analysis can be overly conservative and pessimistic, especially when the investigators believe that some matched sets may have exceptionally large hidden biases. In this paper, we generalize Rosenbaum's framework to conduct sensitivity analysis on quantiles of hidden biases from all matched sets, which are more robust than the maximum. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis on all quantiles of hidden biases is simultaneously valid and is thus a free lunch added to the conventional sensitivity analysis. The proposed approach works for general outcomes, general matched studies and general test statistics. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis also works for bounded null hypotheses as long as the test statistic satisfies certain properties. An R package implementing the proposed method is also available online.",

        "content": "Matching is one of the most widely used study designs for adjusting for measured confounders in observational studies. However, unmeasured confounding may exist and cannot be removed by matching. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis is typically needed to assess a causal conclusion's sensitivity to unmeasured confounding. Sensitivity analysis frameworks for binary exposures have been well-established for various matching designs and are commonly used in various studies. However, unlike the binary exposure case, there still lacks valid and general sensitivity analysis methods for continuous exposures, except in some special cases such as pair matching. To fill this gap in the binary outcome case, we develop a sensitivity analysis framework for general matching designs with continuous exposures and binary outcomes. First, we use probabilistic lattice theory to show our sensitivity analysis approach is finite-population-exact under Fisher's sharp null. Second, we prove a novel design sensitivity formula as a powerful tool for asymptotically evaluating the performance of our sensitivity analysis approach. Third, to allow effect heterogeneity with binary outcomes, we introduce a framework for conducting asymptotically exact inference and sensitivity analysis on generalized attributable effects with binary outcomes via mixed-integer programming. Fourth, for the continuous outcomes case, we show that conducting an asymptotically exact sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies when both the exposures and outcomes are continuous is generally NP-hard, except in some special cases such as pair matching. As a real data application, we apply our new methods to study the effect of early-life lead exposure on juvenile delinquency. We also develop a publicly available R package for implementation of the methods in this work.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-03-21T05:57:43",
        "content": "In matched observational studies with binary treatments, the Rosenbaum bounds framework is arguably the most widely used sensitivity analysis framework for assessing sensitivity to unobserved covariates. Unlike the binary treatment case, although widely needed in practice, sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies with treatment doses (i.e., non-binary treatments such as ordinal treatments or continuous treatments) still lacks solid foundations and valid methodologies. We fill in this blank by establishing theoretical foundations and novel methodologies under a generalized Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis framework. First, we present a criterion for assessing the validity of sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies with treatment doses and use that criterion to justify the necessity of incorporating the treatment dose information into sensitivity analysis through generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds. We also generalize Rosenbaum's classic sensitivity parameter $\\Gamma$ to the non-binary treatment case and prove its sufficiency. Second, we study the asymptotic properties of sensitivity analysis by generalizing Rosenbaum's classic design sensitivity and Bahadur efficiency for testing Fisher's sharp null to the non-binary treatment case and deriving novel formulas for them. Our theoretical results showed the importance of appropriately incorporating the treatment dose into a test, which is an intrinsic distinction with the binary treatment case. Third, for testing Neyman's weak null (i.e., null sample average treatment effect), we propose the first valid sensitivity analysis procedure for matching with treatment dose through generalizing an existing optimization-based sensitivity analysis for the binary treatment case, built on the generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds and large-scale mixed integer programming.",

        "content": "Addressing the significant discrepancy between actual experimental cutting force and its predicted values derived from traditional constitutive model parameter identification methods, a reverse identification research of the Johnson-Cook (J-C) constitutive model for 304 stainless steel was conducted via genetic algorithm. Considering actual cutting zone and the influence of feed motion on the rake (flank) angle, an unequal division shear zone model was established to implement the theoretical calculation for shear zone stress. Through cutting experiments, the spindle speed was negatively correlated with the cutting force at first, and then became positively correlated; The empirical formula (EXP model) for turning force was corrected, revealing that the EXP model was unable to provide optimal predicted values for cutting force. The influence of the J-C constitutive parameter C on the cutting morphology was firstly investigated through simulation analysis, and determined an appropriate value for C, then obtained the precise values for the other four constitutive parameters by genetic algorithm. Moreover, the simulated values of cutting force in JC1 model (obtained from the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar test) and JCM model (the improved model using genetic algorithm) were obtained by three-dimensional (3-D) simulation via FEM software. The results indicated that, the maximum error between actual experimental cutting force and its simulated values (by JCM model) was 14.8%, with an average error of 6.38%. These results outperformed the JC1 and EXP models, suggesting that the JCM model identified via genetic algorithm was more reliable.",

        "content": "Aiming for sensing balloon catheters which are able to provide intraoperative information of the vessel stiffness and shape, the present study uses finite element analysis (FEA) to evaluate the interaction between high-compliant elastomer balloon catheters with the inner wall of a non-cylindrical-shaped lumen structure. The contact simulations are based on 3D models with varying balloon thicknesses and varying tissue geometries to analyse the resulting balloon and tissue deformation as well as the inflation pressure dependent contact area. The wrinkled tissue structure is modelled by utilizing a two-layer fibre-based Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden constitutive model and the model parameters are adapted based on available biomechanical data for human urethral vessel samples. The balloon catheter structure is implemented as a high-compliant hyper-elastic silicone material (based on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)) with a varying catheter wall thickness between 0.5 and 2.5 µm. Two control parameters are introduced to describe the balloon shape adaption in reaction to a wrinkled vessel wall during the inflation process. Basic semi-quantitative relations are revealed depending on the evolving balloon deformation and contact surface. Based on these relations some general design guidelines for balloon-based sensor catheters are presented. The results of the conducted in-silico study reveal some general interdependencies with respect to the compliance ratio between balloon and tissue and also in respect of the tissue aspect ratio. Further they support the proposed concept of high-compliant balloon catheters equipped for tactile sensing as diagnosis approach in urology and angioplasty.",

We propose a new approach of reverse identification for dynamic and static motion error of five-axis machine tools through specimen cutting and feature decomposition. The error mapping between the workpiece features and the corresponding errors is established, and a feature specimen is designed accordingly. By measuring the specimen with the on-machine measurement and CMM, 15 static motion errors and dynamics-induced errors can be identified and separated. The error estimates are verified by the direct measurement via the interferometer, autocollimator and ballbar tests. These errors are compensated using a volumetric error model, and the specimen accuracy after compensation is effectively increased, which confirms the feasibility and accuracy of this method.",

A fundamental landscape of the fungal biogeographical patterns across Chinese wine-producing regions was obtained by characterizing the fungal communities in spontaneous fermentation. After confirming the established national microbial terroir, the fungal heterogeneity was evaluated at different geographical levels. The result showed that the variation between the wineries was more evident than at a regional level. Moreover, the microbial comparability from various regions with similar climates or wineries within the same regions was revealed. Further discriminant analysis determined the specific fungal biomarkers in different regions, while the associated reverse identification model displayed reliable accuracy (>70%). Correlation analysis illustrated the primary role of the geoclimatic factors (>41%) in shaping the fungal geographical patterns, and the relationship between the microbiome and spontaneous fermentation performance. In addition to expanding the knowledge regarding wine microbes, these findings provided a new benchmark for harnessing the microbial terroir to enhance regional wine expression.",

        "title": "Don't quote me: reverse identification of research participants in social media studies.",
        "content": "We investigated if participants in social media surveillance studies could be reverse identified by reviewing all articles published on PubMed in 2015 or 2016 with the words \"Twitter\" and either \"read,\" \"coded,\" or \"content\" in the title or abstract. Seventy-two percent (95% CI: 63-80) of articles quoted at least one participant's tweet and searching for the quoted content led to the participant 84% (95% CI: 74-91) of the time. Twenty-one percent (95% CI: 13-29) of articles disclosed a participant's Twitter username thereby making the participant immediately identifiable. Only one article reported obtaining consent to disclose identifying information and institutional review board (IRB) involvement was mentioned in only 40% (95% CI: 31-50) of articles, of which 17% (95% CI: 10-25) received IRB-approval and 23% (95% CI:16-32) were deemed exempt. Biomedical publications are routinely including identifiable information by quoting tweets or revealing usernames which, in turn, violates ICMJE ethical standards governing scientific ethics, even though said content is scientifically unnecessary. We propose that authors convey aggregate findings without revealing participants' identities, editors refuse to publish reports that reveal a participant's identity, and IRBs attend to these privacy issues when reviewing studies involving social media data. These strategies together will ensure participants are protected going forward.",

        "title": "A reversed framework for the identification of microRNA-target pairs in plants.",
        "content": "Most plant microRNAs (miRNAs) perform their repressive regulation through target cleavages. The resulting slicing sites on the target transcripts could be mapped by sequencing of the 3'-cleavage remnants, called degradome sequencing. The high sequence complementarity between miRNAs and their targets has greatly facilitated the development of the target prediction tools for plant miRNAs. The prediction results were then subjected to degradome sequencing data-based validation, through which numerous miRNA-target interactions have been extracted. However, some drawbacks are unavoidable when using this forward approach. Essentially, a known list of plant miRNAs should be obtained in advance of target prediction and validation. This becomes an obstacle to discover novel miRNAs and their targets. Here, after reviewing the current available algorithms for reverse identification of miRNA-target pairs in plants, a case study was performed by using a newly established framework with adjustable parameters. In this workflow, integration of degradome and ARGONAUTE 1-enriched small RNA sequencing data was recommended to do a relatively comprehensive and reliable search. Besides, several computational algorithms such as BLAST, target plots and RNA secondary structure prediction were used. The results demonstrated the prevalent utility of the reversed approach for uncovering miRNA-target interactions in plants.",

        "content": "Numerous biological mechanisms depend on nucleic acid--protein interactions. The first step to the understanding of these mechanisms is to identify interacting molecules. Knowing one partner, the identification of other associated molecular species can be carried out using affinity-based purification procedures. When the nucleic acid-binding protein is known, the nucleic acid can be isolated and identified by sensitive techniques such as polymerase chain reaction followed by DNA sequencing or hybridization on chips. The reverse identification procedure is less straightforward in part because interesting nucleic acid-binding proteins are generally of low abundance and there are no methods to amplify amino acid sequences. In this article, we will review the strategies that have been developed to identify nucleic acid-binding proteins. We will focus on methods permitting the identification of these proteins without a priori knowledge of protein candidates.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-02-26T12:26:27",
        "content": "In 1953, Grothendieck introduced and studied the Dunford--Pettis property (the $DP$ property) and the strict Dunford--Pettis property (the strict $DP$ property). The $DP$ property of order $p\\in[1,\\infty]$ for Banach spaces was introduced by Castillo and Sanchez in 1993. Being motivated by these notions, for $p,q\\in[1,\\infty]$, we define the strict Dunford--Pettis property of order $p$ (the strict $DP_p$ property) and the sequential Dunford--Pettis property of order $(p,q)$ (the sequential $DP_{(p,q)}$ property). We show that a locally convex space (lcs) $E$ has the $DP$ property iff the space $E$ endowed with the Grothendieck topology $\\tau_{\\Sigma'}$ has the weak Glicksberg property, and $E$ has the strict $DP_p$ property iff the space $(E,\\tau_{\\Sigma'}) $ has the $p$-Schur property. We also characterize lcs with the sequential $DP_{(p,q)}$ property. Some permanent properties and relationships between Dunford--Pettis type properties are studied. Numerous (counter)examples are given. In particular, we give the first example of an lcs with the strict $DP$ property but without the $DP$ property and show that the completion of even normed spaces with the $DP$ property may not have the $DP$ property.",

        "content": "In recent years, biomass carbon materials have received widespread attention in the field of electrochemical sensors. As a new type of renewable green energy, biomass carbon has the advantages of low cost and abundant resources. After special treatment, it can be used as an ideal electrode material. Since biomass carbon materials have diverse sources and their morphology is difficult to control, researchers have conducted in-depth research on their preparation process, morphology regulation and application. This review summarizes different biomass carbon structures and their preparation methods and explores the applications of these materials in electrochemical sensors. Modification of biomass carbon materials through pretreatment, physical and chemical activation, heteroatom doping, metal compound composite and other methods can make up for the deficiencies in its pore structure, electrical conductivity and surface wettability, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. The effects of different biomass sources, functional groups, constituent elements and modification methods on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are discussed, and the applications of this type of material in biological molecules, heavy metal ions and pesticide residues are reviewed. Biomass carbon-based materials show great application potential and development prospects in the field of electrochemical sensors.",

        "title": "Myelin Sheath-Inspired Hydrogel Electrode for Artificial Skin and Physiological Monitoring.",
        "content": "Significant advancements in hydrogel-based epidermal electrodes have been made in recent years. However, inherent limitations, such as adaptability, adhesion, and conductivity, have presented challenges, thereby limiting the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stability of the physiological-electrode interface. In this study, we propose the concept of myelin sheath-inspired hydrogel epidermal electronics by incorporating numerous interpenetrating core-sheath-structured conductive nanofibers within a physically cross-linked polyelectrolyte network. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated sulfonated cellulose nanofibers (PEDOT:SCNFs) are synthesized through a simple solvent-catalyzed sulfonation process, followed by oxidative self-polymerization and ionic liquid (IL) shielding steps, achieving a low electrochemical impedance of 42 Ω. The physical associations within the composite hydrogel network include complexation, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction, and weak entanglements. These properties confer the hydrogel with high stretchability (770%), superconformability, self-adhesion (28 kPa on pigskin), and self-healing capabilities. By simulating the saltatory propagation effect of the nodes of Ranvier in the nervous system, the biomimetic hydrogel establishes high-fidelity epidermal electronic interfaces, offering benefits such as low interfacial contact impedance, significantly increased SNR (30 dB), as well as large-scale sensor array integration. The advanced biomimetic hydrogel holds tremendous potential for applications in electronic skin (e-skin), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and healthcare assessment devices.",

        "title": "Deterministic fabrication of graphene hexagonal boron nitride moiré superlattices.",
        "content": "The electronic properties of moiré heterostructures depend sensitively on the relative orientation between layers of the stack. For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a [Formula: see text] ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near-[Formula: see text], not [Formula: see text], relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy of the graphene/hBN moiré on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, nonaligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moiré heterostructures.",

        "content": "Cow milk (CM) is an important food source for humans, and food allergy caused by CM has attracted attention worldwide. To our knowledge, systematic studies about the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of CM are very rare. In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, and P. pentosaceus fermentation on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability was determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the protein quality, amino acid profile, and color were systematically evaluated. The results showed that these LAB strains exhibited higher protein degradation ability, and the IgE reactivity reduction rate was 41.03%-60.00% and the IgG reduction rate was 29.86%-67.20%, respectively. Additionally, the nutritional value was improved obviously, and the color was altered significantly, which was conductive to develop dairy products. These findings provided a theoretical foundation for the development of hypoallergenic dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus could be considered as good potential candidates for solving cow milk allergy owing to their decreased IgE/IgG binding ability andimproved nutritional and sensory properties, which provide a promising strategy to develop hypoallergenic dairy products.",

        "content": "The thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction represents one of the straightforward approaches to build thietane cores. Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report here a visible-light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls, though a Norrish type II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction with various non-volatile electron-rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocabonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides, as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1-acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer-based mechanism is proposed.",

        "title": "Irish Property Price Estimation Using A Flexible Geo-spatial Smoothing Approach: What is the Impact of an Address?",
        "publishedDate": "2021-08-20T13:46:49",
        "content": "Accurate and efficient valuation of property is of utmost importance in a variety of settings, such as when securing mortgage finance to purchase a property, or where residential property taxes are set as a percentage of a property's resale value. Internationally, resale based property taxes are most common due to ease of implementation and the difficulty of establishing site values. In an Irish context, property valuations are currently based on comparison to recently sold neighbouring properties, however, this approach is limited by low property turnover. National property taxes based on property value, as opposed to site value, also act as a disincentive to improvement works due to the ensuing increased tax burden. In this article we develop a spatial hedonic regression model to separate the spatial and non-spatial contributions of property features to resale value. We mitigate the issue of low property turnover through geographic correlation, borrowing information across multiple property types and finishes. We investigate the impact of address mislabelling on predictive performance, where vendors erroneously supply a more affluent postcode, and evaluate the contribution of improvement works to increased values. Our flexible geo-spatial model outperforms all competitors across a number of different evaluation metrics, including the accuracy of both price prediction and associated uncertainty intervals. While our models are applied in an Irish context, the ability to accurately value properties in markets with low property turnover and to quantify the value contributions of specific property features has widespread application. The ability to separate spatial and non-spatial contributions to a property's value also provides an avenue to site-value based property taxes.",

        "content": "In this contribution, we describe the various research domains in which RuII alkynyl derivatives are involved. Their peculiar molecular properties stem from a strong and intimate overlap between the metal centered d orbitals and the p system of the acetylide ligands, resulting in plethora of fascinating properties such as strong and tunable visible light absorption with a strong MLCT character essential for sensing, photovoltaics, light-harvesting applications or non-linear optical properties. Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices. Altogether, we show in this review the potential of RuII acetylide compounds, insisting on the molecular design and suggesting further research developments for this class of organometallic dyes, including supramolecular chemistry.",

        "content": "Self-assembled polymer grafted nanoparticles (PGNs) are of great interest for their potential to enhance mechanical properties compared to neat polymers and nanocomposites. Apart from volume fraction of nanoparticles, recent experiments have suggested that nanoscale phenomena such as nanoconfinement of grafted chains, altered dynamics and relaxation behavior at the segmental and colloidal scales, and cohesive energy between neighboring coronas are important factors that influence mechanical and rheological properties. How these factors influence the mechanics of thin films subject to micro-ballistic impact remains to be fully understood. Here we examine the micro-ballistic impact resistance of PGN thin films with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grafts using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The grafted chain length and nanoparticle core densities are systematically varied to understand the influences of interparticle spacing, cohesion, and momentum transfer effects under high-velocity impact. Our findings show that the inter-PGN cohesive energy density (",

        "content": "Studies in the existing literature propose that allocryptopine possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showcasing its neuroprotective effects by potentially mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aims to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of allocryptopine on various targets and potential mechanisms that have not been previously explored in the literature. Initially, we used MTT and LDH methods to evaluate the effects of allocryptopine on cell viability in BV-2 cells exposed to LPS-induced damage. Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), other inflammatory mediators (Cox-2 and iNOS), and p38 MAPK genes and proteins through qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Also, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on NF-κB proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p-p50, and p-p65) through ELISA assay. Molecular docking analyses were performed to investigate the potential binding of allocryptopine to target proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p50, p65, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, p38, AP-1 (c-Jun and ATF2), IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Cox-2, and iNOS) associated with the TLR4, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK pathways. Our results indicate that allocryptopine exerts a comprehensive influence on pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and modulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. The outcomes of our study suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy of allocryptopine is intricately linked to the modulation of key molecular pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of allocryptopine as a therapeutic agent for addressing neurodegenerative diseases by safeguarding neuronal health.",

        "content": "The collective behavior in a population of globally coupled oscillators with randomly distributed frequencies is studied when the natural frequency distribution does not possess an even symmetry with respect to the average natural frequency of oscillators. We study the special case of absence of symmetry induced by a group of scaling transformations of the continuous distribution of frequencies. When coupling between oscillators is increased beyond a critical threshold favoring spontaneous synchronization, we found that the variation in the velocity of the traveling wave depends on the extent of asymmetry in the natural frequency distribution. In particular for large coupling this velocity is the average natural frequency whereas at the onset of synchronization it corresponds to the frequency where the Hilbert Transform of the frequency distribution vanishes.",

        "content": "Previous studies on the modification of fast-growing wood have extensively examined the effects of density and lignin content on the strength and high-temperature properties of modified wood. However, a comprehensive quantitative analysis of their effects on high-temperature performance remains insufficient. To address this knowledge gap, we applied alkali treatment and compression densification to fast-growing poplar, resulting in modified specimens with varying densities and lignin levels. The quantitative effects of density and lignin content on high-temperature properties were meticulously evaluated. Chemical changes were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), while the mechanical and high-temperature properties were comprehensively assessed. Delignification was found to be positively correlated with treatment duration, with hemicellulose degradation also detected via FT-IR analysis. Significant enhancements were recorded in flexural strength, tensile strength, and modulus of elasticity, accompanied by improvements in ductility ratio and compressive strength. The modified poplar wood exhibited increased thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, density and lignin content were identified as significant factors affecting high-temperature performance, establishing minimum density thresholds for various lignin contents in modified poplar wood to ensure optimal performance. This study enhances to the understanding of the intricate relationships among wood properties, modification techniques, and high-temperature performance.",

The results illustrates that the incident wave can enhance the resonance response at the redistributed resonance frequency, which leads to an increase in radial acceleration and the secondary Bjerknes force, and rapid approach of bubbles. Furthermore, the influence of incident wave on the interaction of bubbles driven at lower frequencies is more significant, due to resonance enhancement caused by the proximity of natural frequencies and frequency multiplications of the external sound field. Our findings reveal that the compressible effect is not only critical to interaction in radial oscillations, but also in translational motion.",

        "content": "Synchronization among rhythmic elements is modeled by coupled phase-oscillators each of which has the so-called natural frequency. A symmetric natural frequency distribution induces a continuous or discontinuous synchronization transition from the nonsynchronized state, for instance. It has been numerically reported that asymmetry in the natural frequency distribution brings new types of bifurcation diagram having, in the order parameter, oscillation or a discontinuous jump which emerges from a partially synchronized state. We propose a theoretical classification method of five types of bifurcation diagrams including the new ones, paying attention to the generality of the theory. The oscillation and the jump from partially synchronized states are discussed respectively by the linear analysis around the nonsynchronized state and by extending the amplitude equation up to the third leading term. The theoretical classification is examined by comparing with numerically obtained one.",

        "content": "Renewable feedstocks are sought for clean technology applications, including energy storage applications. In this study, LignoForce™ lignin, a biobased aromatic polymer commercially isolated from wood, was fractioned into two parts using acetone, and the resulting lignin fractions had distinct thermo-rheological behavior. These two fractionated lignins were combined in various ratios and transformed into nanofibers by electrospinning. Subsequently, electrospun fiber materials were disrupted by agitating the mats in water, and the materials were transformed into ultralight 3D aerogels through lyophilization and post-process controlled heating. Using only this combination of two fractions, the morphology of lignin nanofibers was tailored by heat treatment, resulting in lignin aerogels with high flexibility and significant shape recovery properties. Various microscale structures of lignin fibers impacted the resulting physical properties of the elastic aerogel materials, such as resilience, compressive strength, and electrical conductivity for the corresponding carbonized samples. By exploiting lignin's sensitivity to heat and tailoring the thermal properties of the lignin through fractionation, the work provided an interesting path to form robust lignin-derived functional materials without any toxic chemical additives and significant ability to serve as free-standing electrodes with specific capacitance values better than some graphene-based supercapacitors.",

It is well known that for a spring-mass system wherein the adjacent masses are linked through a spring, the natural frequency assignment can be achieved by choosing appropriate masses and spring stiffnesses if and only if the given positive eigenvalues are distinct. However, when we involve inerters, multiple eigenvalues in the assignment are allowed. In fact, arbitrarily given a set of positive real numbers, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition on the multiplicities of these numbers, which are assigned as the natural frequencies of the concerned mass-spring-inerter system.",

        "content": "It is well established that the natural frequencies (NF) format is cognitively more beneficial for Bayesian inference than the conditional probabilities (CP) format. However, empirical studies have suggested that the NF facilitation effect might be limited to specific groups of individuals. Unlike previous studies that focused on a limited number of Bayesian inference problems evaluated by a single scoring method, it was essential to examine multiple Bayesian problems using various scoring metrics. This study also explored the impact of numeracy on Bayesian inference and assessed non-Bayesian cognitive strategies using the numerical information in problem solving.",

        "publishedDate": "2021-06-11T15:59:33",
        "content": "For natural frequency optimization of engineering structures, cellular composites have been shown to possess an edge over solid. However, existing multiscale design methods for cellular composites are either computationally exhaustive or confined to a single class of microstructures. In this paper, we propose a data-driven topology optimization (TO) approach to enable the multiscale design of cellular structures with various choices of microstructure classes. The key component is a newly proposed latent-variable Gaussian process (LVGP) model through which different classes of microstructures are mapped into a low-dimensional continuous latent space. It provides an interpretable distance metric between classes and captures their effects on the homogenized stiffness tensors. By introducing latent vectors as design variables, a differentiable transition of stiffness matrix between classes can be easily achieved with an analytical gradient. After integrating LVGP with the density-based TO, an efficient data-driven cellular composite optimization process is developed to enable concurrent exploration of microstructure concepts and the associated volume fractions for natural frequency optimization. Examples reveal that the proposed cellular designs with multiclass microstructures achieve higher natural frequencies than both single-scale and single-class designs. This framework can be easily extended to other multi-scale TO problems, such as thermal compliance and dynamic response optimization.",

        "content": "The pulp and paper industry generates vast quantities of paper sludge, posing significant environmental challenges due to its disposal in landfills or incineration. This study explores the potential of valorizing paper sludge by incorporating it into particleboard production. It aims to optimize sludge content and particle size to enhance board properties-a novel approach to waste management in the wood composites industry. Through systematic variation of sludge content (0-25%) and particle size (< 0.5 to > 2 mm), we assessed the mechanical and physical properties such as internal bond strength (IB), modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), water absorption (WA), and thickness swelling (TS). The findings indicate that incorporating paper sludge at moderate levels (5-15%) with optimized particle sizes (< 1 mm) significantly improves the mechanical properties of the particleboard, including increased IB, MOR, and MOE while reducing WA and TS. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) further supported these results, revealing that higher-density boards with enhanced mechanical properties absorb less water, highlighting the interrelationship between structural integrity and moisture resistance. The PCA also identified thickness swelling as an independent factor, suggesting that while mechanical properties can be optimized, additional strategies are needed to control swelling. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that up to 15% paper sludge can be effectively used in particleboard production without compromising quality, provided particle size is carefully controlled. This approach not only offers a sustainable solution for managing paper sludge but also contributes to the development of eco-friendly composite materials, aligning with circular economy principles.",

        "content": "The paper studies the topological changes from before and after cointegration, for the natural frequencies of the Z24 Bridge. The second natural frequency is known to be nonlinear in temperature, and this will serve as the main focal point of this work. Cointegration is a method of normalising time series data with respect to one another - often strongly-correlated time series. Cointegration is used in this paper to remove effects from Environmental and Operational Variations, by cointegrating the first four natural frequencies for the Z24 Bridge data. The temperature effects on the natural frequency data are clearly visible within the data, and it is desirable, for the purposes of structural health monitoring, that these effects are removed. The univariate time series are embedded in higher-dimensional space, such that interesting topologies are formed. Topological data analysis is used to analyse the raw time series, and the cointegrated equivalents. A standard topological data analysis pipeline is enacted, where simplicial complexes are constructed from the embedded point clouds. Topological properties are then calculated from the simplicial complexes; such as the persistent homology. The persistent homology is then analysed, to determine the topological structure of all the time series.",

        "content": "The multidimensional Kuramoto model describes the synchronization dynamics of particles moving on the surface of D-dimensional spheres, generalizing the original model where particles were characterized by a single phase. In this setup, particles are more easily represented by $D$-dimensional unit vectors than by $D-1$ spherical angles, allowing for the coupling constant to be extended to a coupling matrix acting on the vectors. As in the original Kuramoto model, each particle has a set of $D(D-1)/2$ natural frequencies, drawn from a distribution. The system has a large number of independent parameters, given by the average natural frequencies, the characteristic widths of their distributions plus $D^2$ constants of the coupling matrix. General phase diagrams, indicating regions in parameter space where the system exhibits different behaviors, are hard to derive analytically. Here we obtain the complete phase diagram for $D=2$ and Lorentzian distributions of natural frequencies using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz. We also explore the diagrams numerically for different distributions and some specific choices of parameters for $D=2$, $D=3$ and $D=4$. In all cases the system exhibits at most four different phases: disordered, static synchrony, rotation and active synchrony. Existence of specific phases and boundaries between them depend strongly on the dimension $D$, the coupling matrix and the distribution of natural frequencies.",

        "content": "As a mature non-destructive testing technology, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy can effectively identify and distinguish the structural characteristics of wood. The Wood Defect One-Dimensional Visual Geometry Group 19-Finite Element Analysis (WD-1D-VGG19-FEA) algorithm is used in this study. 1D-VGG19 classifies the near-infrared spectroscopy data to determine the knot area, fiber deviation area, transition area, and net wood area of the solid wood board surface and generates a two-dimensional image of the board surface through inversion. Then, the nonlinear three-dimensional model of wood with defects was established by using the inverse image, and the finite element analysis was carried out to predict the elastic modulus of wood. In the experiment, 270 points were selected from each of the four regions of the wood, totaling 1080 sets of near-infrared data, and the 1D-VGG19 model was used for classification. The results showed that the identification accuracy of the knot area was 95.1%, the fiber deviation area was 92.7%, the transition area was 90.2%, the net wood area was 100%, and the average accuracy was 94.5%. The error range of the elastic modulus prediction of the three-dimensional model established by the VGG19 classification model in the finite element analysis is between 2% and 10%, the root mean square error (RMSE) is about 598. 2, and the coefficient of determination (R2) is 0. 91. This study shows that the combination of the VGG19 algorithm and finite element analysis can accurately describe the nonlinear defect morphology of wood, thus establishing a more accurate prediction model of wood mechanical properties to maximize the use of wood mechanical properties.",

When we introduce disorder in these frequencies, we find limit cycles with periods that are orders of magnitude longer than the natural frequencies of individual oscillators. Moreover we identify sequences of temporary patterns of phase-locked motion, which are self-similar in time and whose periods scale with a power of the inverse width about a uniform frequency distribution.

Specifically, my work answers three research questions: 1) Do different sensitivity analysis (SA) methods yield comparable outputs and attribute importance rankings? 2) Using the same sensitivity analysis method, do different Deep Learning (DL) models impact the output of the sensitivity analysis? 3) How well do the results from sensitivity analysis methods align with the ground truth?",

        "content": "Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a Class C infectious disease that carries particularly high risk for preschool children and is a leading cause of childhood death in some countries. We mimic the periodic outbreak of HFMD over a 2-year period-with differing amplitudes-and propose a dynamic HFMD model that differentiates transmission between mature and immature individuals and uses two possible optimal-control strategies to minimize case numbers, total costs and deaths. We parameterized the model by fitting it to HFMD data in mainland China from January 2011 to December 2018, and the basic reproduction number was estimated as 0.9599. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that transmission between immature and mature individuals contributes substantially to new infections. Increasing the isolation rates of infectious individuals-particularly mature infectious individuals-could greatly reduce the outbreak risk and potentially eradicate the disease in a relatively short time period. It follows that we have a reasonable chance of controlling HFMD if we can reduce transmission in children under 7 and isolate older infectious individuals.",

For a given counterfactual policy, we obtain identified sets for the effect of both marginal and global changes in the proportion of treated individuals. To conduct a sensitivity analysis, we introduce the quantile breakdown frontier, a curve that (i) indicates whether a sensitivity analysis is possible or not, and (ii) when a sensitivity analysis is possible, quantifies the amount of selection bias consistent with a given conclusion of interest across different quantiles. To illustrate our method, we perform a sensitivity analysis on the effect of unionizing low income workers on the quantiles of the distribution of (log) wages.",

This study is a preliminary evaluation of graded exposure therapy (GET), which directly targets fear avoidance behaviour, for reducing post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and disability following mTBI. In a historical comparison design, we compared two groups from independent randomized trials. The GET + UC group (N = 34) received GET (delivered over 16 videoconference sessions) in addition to usual care (UC). The historical comparison group (N = 71) received UC only. PCS severity (Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire; RPQ) and disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule; WHODAS 2.0 12-item) were measured at clinic intake (M = 2.7, SD = 1.1 months after injury) and again at M = 4.9 (SD = 1.1) months after injury. Between-group differences were estimated using linear mixed effects regression, with a sensitivity analysis controlling for injury-to-assessment intervals. The estimated average change on the RPQ was -14.3 in the GET + UC group and -5.3 in the UC group. The estimated average change on the WHODAS was -5.3 in the GET + UC group and -3.2 in the UC group. Between-group differences post-treatment were -5.3 on the RPQ and -1.5 on the WHODAS. Treatment effects were larger in sensitivity analyses. Findings suggest that a randomized controlled trial is warranted.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-09-12T16:36:22",
        "content": "In matched observational studies, the inferred causal conclusions pretending that matching has taken into account all confounding can be sensitive to unmeasured confounding. In such cases, a sensitivity analysis is often conducted, which investigates whether the observed association between treatment and outcome is due to effects caused by the treatment or it is due to hidden confounding. In general, a sensitivity analysis tries to infer the minimum amount of hidden biases needed in order to explain away the observed association between treatment and outcome, assuming that the treatment has no effect. If the needed bias is large, then the treatment is likely to have significant effects. The Rosenbaum sensitivity analysis is a modern approach for conducting sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies. It investigates what magnitude the maximum of the hidden biases from all matched sets needs to be in order to explain away the observed association, assuming that the treatment has no effect. However, such a sensitivity analysis can be overly conservative and pessimistic, especially when the investigators believe that some matched sets may have exceptionally large hidden biases. In this paper, we generalize Rosenbaum's framework to conduct sensitivity analysis on quantiles of hidden biases from all matched sets, which are more robust than the maximum. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis on all quantiles of hidden biases is simultaneously valid and is thus a free lunch added to the conventional sensitivity analysis. The proposed approach works for general outcomes, general matched studies and general test statistics. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis also works for bounded null hypotheses as long as the test statistic satisfies certain properties. An R package implementing the proposed method is also available online.",

        "content": "A highly versatile evaluation method is proposed for transient plasmas based on statistical physics. It would be beneficial in various industrial sectors, including semiconductors and automobiles. Our research focused on low-energy plasmas in laboratory settings, and they were assessed via our proposed method, which incorporates relative entropy and fractional Brownian motion, based on a revised collisional-radiative model. By introducing an indicator to evaluate how far a system is from its steady state, both the trend of entropy and the radiative process' contribution to the lifetime of excited states were considered. The high statistical weight of some excited states may act as a bottleneck in the plasma's energy relaxation throughout the system to a steady state. By deepening our understanding of how energy flows through plasmas, we anticipate potential contributions to resolving global environmental issues and fostering technological innovation in plasma-related industrial fields.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-01-12T21:49:25",
        "content": "Matching is one of the most widely used study designs for adjusting for measured confounders in observational studies. However, unmeasured confounding may exist and cannot be removed by matching. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis is typically needed to assess a causal conclusion's sensitivity to unmeasured confounding. Sensitivity analysis frameworks for binary exposures have been well-established for various matching designs and are commonly used in various studies. However, unlike the binary exposure case, there still lacks valid and general sensitivity analysis methods for continuous exposures, except in some special cases such as pair matching. To fill this gap in the binary outcome case, we develop a sensitivity analysis framework for general matching designs with continuous exposures and binary outcomes. First, we use probabilistic lattice theory to show our sensitivity analysis approach is finite-population-exact under Fisher's sharp null. Second, we prove a novel design sensitivity formula as a powerful tool for asymptotically evaluating the performance of our sensitivity analysis approach. Third, to allow effect heterogeneity with binary outcomes, we introduce a framework for conducting asymptotically exact inference and sensitivity analysis on generalized attributable effects with binary outcomes via mixed-integer programming. Fourth, for the continuous outcomes case, we show that conducting an asymptotically exact sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies when both the exposures and outcomes are continuous is generally NP-hard, except in some special cases such as pair matching. As a real data application, we apply our new methods to study the effect of early-life lead exposure on juvenile delinquency. We also develop a publicly available R package for implementation of the methods in this work.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-03-21T05:57:43",
        "content": "In matched observational studies with binary treatments, the Rosenbaum bounds framework is arguably the most widely used sensitivity analysis framework for assessing sensitivity to unobserved covariates. Unlike the binary treatment case, although widely needed in practice, sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies with treatment doses (i.e., non-binary treatments such as ordinal treatments or continuous treatments) still lacks solid foundations and valid methodologies. We fill in this blank by establishing theoretical foundations and novel methodologies under a generalized Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis framework. First, we present a criterion for assessing the validity of sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies with treatment doses and use that criterion to justify the necessity of incorporating the treatment dose information into sensitivity analysis through generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds. We also generalize Rosenbaum's classic sensitivity parameter $\\Gamma$ to the non-binary treatment case and prove its sufficiency. Second, we study the asymptotic properties of sensitivity analysis by generalizing Rosenbaum's classic design sensitivity and Bahadur efficiency for testing Fisher's sharp null to the non-binary treatment case and deriving novel formulas for them. Our theoretical results showed the importance of appropriately incorporating the treatment dose into a test, which is an intrinsic distinction with the binary treatment case. Third, for testing Neyman's weak null (i.e., null sample average treatment effect), we propose the first valid sensitivity analysis procedure for matching with treatment dose through generalizing an existing optimization-based sensitivity analysis for the binary treatment case, built on the generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds and large-scale mixed integer programming.",

        "content": "Previous studies on the modification of fast-growing wood have extensively examined the effects of density and lignin content on the strength and high-temperature properties of modified wood. However, a comprehensive quantitative analysis of their effects on high-temperature performance remains insufficient. To address this knowledge gap, we applied alkali treatment and compression densification to fast-growing poplar, resulting in modified specimens with varying densities and lignin levels. The quantitative effects of density and lignin content on high-temperature properties were meticulously evaluated. Chemical changes were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), while the mechanical and high-temperature properties were comprehensively assessed. Delignification was found to be positively correlated with treatment duration, with hemicellulose degradation also detected via FT-IR analysis. Significant enhancements were recorded in flexural strength, tensile strength, and modulus of elasticity, accompanied by improvements in ductility ratio and compressive strength. The modified poplar wood exhibited increased thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, density and lignin content were identified as significant factors affecting high-temperature performance, establishing minimum density thresholds for various lignin contents in modified poplar wood to ensure optimal performance. This study enhances to the understanding of the intricate relationships among wood properties, modification techniques, and high-temperature performance.",

        "content": "Renewable feedstocks are sought for clean technology applications, including energy storage applications. In this study, LignoForce™ lignin, a biobased aromatic polymer commercially isolated from wood, was fractioned into two parts using acetone, and the resulting lignin fractions had distinct thermo-rheological behavior. These two fractionated lignins were combined in various ratios and transformed into nanofibers by electrospinning. Subsequently, electrospun fiber materials were disrupted by agitating the mats in water, and the materials were transformed into ultralight 3D aerogels through lyophilization and post-process controlled heating. Using only this combination of two fractions, the morphology of lignin nanofibers was tailored by heat treatment, resulting in lignin aerogels with high flexibility and significant shape recovery properties. Various microscale structures of lignin fibers impacted the resulting physical properties of the elastic aerogel materials, such as resilience, compressive strength, and electrical conductivity for the corresponding carbonized samples. By exploiting lignin's sensitivity to heat and tailoring the thermal properties of the lignin through fractionation, the work provided an interesting path to form robust lignin-derived functional materials without any toxic chemical additives and significant ability to serve as free-standing electrodes with specific capacitance values better than some graphene-based supercapacitors.",

Understanding and tailoring anisotropy in crystals is therefore essential for the design of next-generation functional materials. To date, however, most data-driven approaches have focused on the prediction of scalar crystal properties, such as the spherically averaged dielectric tensor or the bulk and shear elastic moduli.

        "content": "The pulp and paper industry generates vast quantities of paper sludge, posing significant environmental challenges due to its disposal in landfills or incineration. This study explores the potential of valorizing paper sludge by incorporating it into particleboard production. It aims to optimize sludge content and particle size to enhance board properties-a novel approach to waste management in the wood composites industry. Through systematic variation of sludge content (0-25%) and particle size (< 0.5 to > 2 mm), we assessed the mechanical and physical properties such as internal bond strength (IB), modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), water absorption (WA), and thickness swelling (TS). The findings indicate that incorporating paper sludge at moderate levels (5-15%) with optimized particle sizes (< 1 mm) significantly improves the mechanical properties of the particleboard, including increased IB, MOR, and MOE while reducing WA and TS. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) further supported these results, revealing that higher-density boards with enhanced mechanical properties absorb less water, highlighting the interrelationship between structural integrity and moisture resistance. The PCA also identified thickness swelling as an independent factor, suggesting that while mechanical properties can be optimized, additional strategies are needed to control swelling. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that up to 15% paper sludge can be effectively used in particleboard production without compromising quality, provided particle size is carefully controlled. This approach not only offers a sustainable solution for managing paper sludge but also contributes to the development of eco-friendly composite materials, aligning with circular economy principles.",

The Wood Defect One-Dimensional Visual Geometry Group 19-Finite Element Analysis (WD-1D-VGG19-FEA) algorithm is used in this study. 1D-VGG19 classifies the near-infrared spectroscopy data to determine the knot area, fiber deviation area, transition area, and net wood area of the solid wood board surface and generates a two-dimensional image of the board surface through inversion. Then, the nonlinear three-dimensional model of wood with defects was established by using the inverse image, and the finite element analysis was carried out to predict the elastic modulus of wood. In the experiment, 270 points were selected from each of the four regions of the wood, totaling 1080 sets of near-infrared data, and the 1D-VGG19 model was used for classification. The results showed that the identification accuracy of the knot area was 95.1%, the fiber deviation area was 92.7%, the transition area was 90.2%, the net wood area was 100%, and the average accuracy was 94.5%. The error range of the elastic modulus prediction of the three-dimensional model established by the VGG19 classification model in the finite element analysis is between 2% and 10%, the root mean square error (RMSE) is about 598. 2, and the coefficient of determination (R2) is 0. 91. This study shows that the combination of the VGG19 algorithm and finite element analysis can accurately describe the nonlinear defect morphology of wood, thus establishing a more accurate prediction model of wood mechanical properties to maximize the use of wood mechanical properties.",

Through cutting experiments, the spindle speed was negatively correlated with the cutting force at first, and then became positively correlated; The empirical formula (EXP model) for turning force was corrected, revealing that the EXP model was unable to provide optimal predicted values for cutting force. The influence of the J-C constitutive parameter C on the cutting morphology was firstly investigated through simulation analysis, and determined an appropriate value for C, then obtained the precise values for the other four constitutive parameters by genetic algorithm. Moreover, the simulated values of cutting force in JC1 model (obtained from the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar test) and JCM model (the improved model using genetic algorithm) were obtained by three-dimensional (3-D) simulation via FEM software. The results indicated that, the maximum error between actual experimental cutting force and its simulated values (by JCM model) was 14.8%, with an average error of 6.38%. These results outperformed the JC1 and EXP models, suggesting that the JCM model identified via genetic algorithm was more reliable.",

        "content": "The aim of the study was to identify limiting factors for reusing wood through the recycling of window frames by conducting research under fully controlled conditions. The research involved manufacturing new window frames, seasoning them, and then shredding them into wood particles to prepare a three-layer particleboard. The proportion of wood particles in recycling was 0, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 parts by weight of the manufactured particleboard. Mechanical property tests were conducted: modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR), internal bond (IB), screw withdrawal resistance (SWR), and physical properties: density profile (DP), thickness swelling (TS) after water immersion, water absorption (WA), as well as formaldehyde emission and total volatile organic compound (TVOCs) tests. The research indicates a significant potential for utilizing wood from this sector of the wood industry, particularly considering variants with a higher proportion of recycled wood. MOR and MOE results are most promising for variants above 50 parts by weight of recycled wood. Based on the results obtained, it is clear that the production process should be improved or the raw material modified to enhance the internal bonding of particleboard, as these results were the weakest. Thus, recycled wood from window joinery has the potential to be reincarnated as particleboard, which continues to be widely used in their production.",

        "content": "Nonwoven upholstery fabric is a waste product which is mainly generated during upholstered furniture production. The polyester composition makes it problematic to recycle and reuse this product. This study examined the manufacturing process of nonwoven fabric-reinforced plywood composites and their selected mechanical and physical properties. Nonwoven fabric was integrated between veneers bound with urea-formaldehyde resin to improve standard layered composites' mechanical and physical properties. Several board variants were produced, differing in the position of the nonwoven layers in the composite structure. The composites were evaluated for modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), internal bond, and screw withdrawal resistance, among others. The results showed that the addition of nonwoven fabric significantly improved some properties, like internal bond and screw withdrawal resistance. Variants with strategically placed nonwoven layers showed the highest performance increases. The results underscore the potential of nonwoven fabric as an effective reinforcing material, offering a path to developing high-performance plywood composites suitable for demanding applications. Another environmental advantage is that the nonwoven fabric waste used in the tested plywood production has not been subjected to burning or landfilling but, through its incorporation into plywood structure, has positively contributed to the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) policy. The findings advocate for a circular economy approach, in which industrial waste is effectively repurposed, contributing to the development of green materials in the wood-based composite industry.",

As a new type of renewable green energy, biomass carbon has the advantages of low cost and abundant resources. After special treatment, it can be used as an ideal electrode material. Since biomass carbon materials have diverse sources and their morphology is difficult to control, researchers have conducted in-depth research on their preparation process, morphology regulation and application. This review summarizes different biomass carbon structures and their preparation methods and explores the applications of these materials in electrochemical sensors. Modification of biomass carbon materials through pretreatment, physical and chemical activation, heteroatom doping, metal compound composite and other methods can make up for the deficiencies in its pore structure, electrical conductivity and surface wettability, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. The effects of different biomass sources, functional groups, constituent elements and modification methods on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are discussed, and the applications of this type of material in biological molecules, heavy metal ions and pesticide residues are reviewed. Biomass carbon-based materials show great application potential and development prospects in the field of electrochemical sensors.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-02-26T12:26:27",
        "content": "In 1953, Grothendieck introduced and studied the Dunford--Pettis property (the $DP$ property) and the strict Dunford--Pettis property (the strict $DP$ property). The $DP$ property of order $p\\in[1,\\infty]$ for Banach spaces was introduced by Castillo and Sanchez in 1993. Being motivated by these notions, for $p,q\\in[1,\\infty]$, we define the strict Dunford--Pettis property of order $p$ (the strict $DP_p$ property) and the sequential Dunford--Pettis property of order $(p,q)$ (the sequential $DP_{(p,q)}$ property). We show that a locally convex space (lcs) $E$ has the $DP$ property iff the space $E$ endowed with the Grothendieck topology $\\tau_{\\Sigma'}$ has the weak Glicksberg property, and $E$ has the strict $DP_p$ property iff the space $(E,\\tau_{\\Sigma'}) $ has the $p$-Schur property. We also characterize lcs with the sequential $DP_{(p,q)}$ property. Some permanent properties and relationships between Dunford--Pettis type properties are studied. Numerous (counter)examples are given. In particular, we give the first example of an lcs with the strict $DP$ property but without the $DP$ property and show that the completion of even normed spaces with the $DP$ property may not have the $DP$ property.",

        "content": "Significant advancements in hydrogel-based epidermal electrodes have been made in recent years. However, inherent limitations, such as adaptability, adhesion, and conductivity, have presented challenges, thereby limiting the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stability of the physiological-electrode interface. In this study, we propose the concept of myelin sheath-inspired hydrogel epidermal electronics by incorporating numerous interpenetrating core-sheath-structured conductive nanofibers within a physically cross-linked polyelectrolyte network. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated sulfonated cellulose nanofibers (PEDOT:SCNFs) are synthesized through a simple solvent-catalyzed sulfonation process, followed by oxidative self-polymerization and ionic liquid (IL) shielding steps, achieving a low electrochemical impedance of 42 Ω. The physical associations within the composite hydrogel network include complexation, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction, and weak entanglements. These properties confer the hydrogel with high stretchability (770%), superconformability, self-adhesion (28 kPa on pigskin), and self-healing capabilities. By simulating the saltatory propagation effect of the nodes of Ranvier in the nervous system, the biomimetic hydrogel establishes high-fidelity epidermal electronic interfaces, offering benefits such as low interfacial contact impedance, significantly increased SNR (30 dB), as well as large-scale sensor array integration. The advanced biomimetic hydrogel holds tremendous potential for applications in electronic skin (e-skin), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and healthcare assessment devices.",

        "title": "Deterministic fabrication of graphene hexagonal boron nitride moiré superlattices.",
        "content": "The electronic properties of moiré heterostructures depend sensitively on the relative orientation between layers of the stack. For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a [Formula: see text] ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near-[Formula: see text], not [Formula: see text], relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy of the graphene/hBN moiré on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, nonaligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moiré heterostructures.",

        "content": "Cow milk (CM) is an important food source for humans, and food allergy caused by CM has attracted attention worldwide. To our knowledge, systematic studies about the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of CM are very rare. In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, and P. pentosaceus fermentation on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability was determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the protein quality, amino acid profile, and color were systematically evaluated. The results showed that these LAB strains exhibited higher protein degradation ability, and the IgE reactivity reduction rate was 41.03%-60.00% and the IgG reduction rate was 29.86%-67.20%, respectively. Additionally, the nutritional value was improved obviously, and the color was altered significantly, which was conductive to develop dairy products. These findings provided a theoretical foundation for the development of hypoallergenic dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus could be considered as good potential candidates for solving cow milk allergy owing to their decreased IgE/IgG binding ability andimproved nutritional and sensory properties, which provide a promising strategy to develop hypoallergenic dairy products.",

Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report here a visible-light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls, though a Norrish type II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction with various non-volatile electron-rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocabonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides, as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1-acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer-based mechanism is proposed.",

Their peculiar molecular properties stem from a strong and intimate overlap between the metal centered d orbitals and the p system of the acetylide ligands, resulting in plethora of fascinating properties such as strong and tunable visible light absorption with a strong MLCT character essential for sensing, photovoltaics, light-harvesting applications or non-linear optical properties. Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices.

        "publishedDate": "2021-08-20T13:46:49",
        "content": "Accurate and efficient valuation of property is of utmost importance in a variety of settings, such as when securing mortgage finance to purchase a property, or where residential property taxes are set as a percentage of a property's resale value. Internationally, resale based property taxes are most common due to ease of implementation and the difficulty of establishing site values. In an Irish context, property valuations are currently based on comparison to recently sold neighbouring properties, however, this approach is limited by low property turnover. National property taxes based on property value, as opposed to site value, also act as a disincentive to improvement works due to the ensuing increased tax burden. In this article we develop a spatial hedonic regression model to separate the spatial and non-spatial contributions of property features to resale value. We mitigate the issue of low property turnover through geographic correlation, borrowing information across multiple property types and finishes. We investigate the impact of address mislabelling on predictive performance, where vendors erroneously supply a more affluent postcode, and evaluate the contribution of improvement works to increased values. Our flexible geo-spatial model outperforms all competitors across a number of different evaluation metrics, including the accuracy of both price prediction and associated uncertainty intervals. While our models are applied in an Irish context, the ability to accurately value properties in markets with low property turnover and to quantify the value contributions of specific property features has widespread application. The ability to separate spatial and non-spatial contributions to a property's value also provides an avenue to site-value based property taxes.",

        "content": "Self-assembled polymer grafted nanoparticles (PGNs) are of great interest for their potential to enhance mechanical properties compared to neat polymers and nanocomposites. Apart from volume fraction of nanoparticles, recent experiments have suggested that nanoscale phenomena such as nanoconfinement of grafted chains, altered dynamics and relaxation behavior at the segmental and colloidal scales, and cohesive energy between neighboring coronas are important factors that influence mechanical and rheological properties. How these factors influence the mechanics of thin films subject to micro-ballistic impact remains to be fully understood. Here we examine the micro-ballistic impact resistance of PGN thin films with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grafts using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The grafted chain length and nanoparticle core densities are systematically varied to understand the influences of interparticle spacing, cohesion, and momentum transfer effects under high-velocity impact. Our findings show that the inter-PGN cohesive energy density (",

        "content": "Studies in the existing literature propose that allocryptopine possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showcasing its neuroprotective effects by potentially mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aims to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of allocryptopine on various targets and potential mechanisms that have not been previously explored in the literature. Initially, we used MTT and LDH methods to evaluate the effects of allocryptopine on cell viability in BV-2 cells exposed to LPS-induced damage. Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), other inflammatory mediators (Cox-2 and iNOS), and p38 MAPK genes and proteins through qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Also, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on NF-κB proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p-p50, and p-p65) through ELISA assay. Molecular docking analyses were performed to investigate the potential binding of allocryptopine to target proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p50, p65, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, p38, AP-1 (c-Jun and ATF2), IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Cox-2, and iNOS) associated with the TLR4, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK pathways. Our results indicate that allocryptopine exerts a comprehensive influence on pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and modulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. The outcomes of our study suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy of allocryptopine is intricately linked to the modulation of key molecular pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of allocryptopine as a therapeutic agent for addressing neurodegenerative diseases by safeguarding neuronal health.",

Sensitivity analysis assesses how input changes affect the output, constituting a key component of interpretation. Among the post-hoc interpretation methods such as back-propagation, perturbation, and approximation, my work will investigate perturbation-based sensitivity Analysis methods on modern Transformer models to benchmark their performances. Specifically, my work answers three research questions: 1) Do different sensitivity analysis (SA) methods yield comparable outputs and attribute importance rankings? 2) Using the same sensitivity analysis method, do different Deep Learning (DL) models impact the output of the sensitivity analysis? 3) How well do the results from sensitivity analysis methods align with the ground truth?",

        "content": "Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a Class C infectious disease that carries particularly high risk for preschool children and is a leading cause of childhood death in some countries. We mimic the periodic outbreak of HFMD over a 2-year period-with differing amplitudes-and propose a dynamic HFMD model that differentiates transmission between mature and immature individuals and uses two possible optimal-control strategies to minimize case numbers, total costs and deaths. We parameterized the model by fitting it to HFMD data in mainland China from January 2011 to December 2018, and the basic reproduction number was estimated as 0.9599. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that transmission between immature and mature individuals contributes substantially to new infections. Increasing the isolation rates of infectious individuals-particularly mature infectious individuals-could greatly reduce the outbreak risk and potentially eradicate the disease in a relatively short time period. It follows that we have a reasonable chance of controlling HFMD if we can reduce transmission in children under 7 and isolate older infectious individuals.",

For a given counterfactual policy, we obtain identified sets for the effect of both marginal and global changes in the proportion of treated individuals. To conduct a sensitivity analysis, we introduce the quantile breakdown frontier, a curve that (i) indicates whether a sensitivity analysis is possible or not, and (ii) when a sensitivity analysis is possible, quantifies the amount of selection bias consistent with a given conclusion of interest across different quantiles. To illustrate our method, we perform a sensitivity analysis on the effect of unionizing low income workers on the quantiles of the distribution of (log) wages.",

This study is a preliminary evaluation of graded exposure therapy (GET), which directly targets fear avoidance behaviour, for reducing post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and disability following mTBI. In a historical comparison design, we compared two groups from independent randomized trials. The GET + UC group (N = 34) received GET (delivered over 16 videoconference sessions) in addition to usual care (UC). The historical comparison group (N = 71) received UC only. PCS severity (Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire; RPQ) and disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule; WHODAS 2.0 12-item) were measured at clinic intake (M = 2.7, SD = 1.1 months after injury) and again at M = 4.9 (SD = 1.1) months after injury. Between-group differences were estimated using linear mixed effects regression, with a sensitivity analysis controlling for injury-to-assessment intervals. The estimated average change on the RPQ was -14.3 in the GET + UC group and -5.3 in the UC group. The estimated average change on the WHODAS was -5.3 in the GET + UC group and -3.2 in the UC group. Between-group differences post-treatment were -5.3 on the RPQ and -1.5 on the WHODAS. Treatment effects were larger in sensitivity analyses. Findings suggest that a randomized controlled trial is warranted.",

        "content": "This paper presents a transient forward harmonic adjoint sensitivity analysis (TFHA), which is a combination of a transient forward circuit analysis with a harmonic balance based adjoint sensitivity analysis. TFHA provides sensitivities of quantities of interest from time-periodic problems w.r.t. many design parameters, as used in the design process of power-electronics devices. The TFHA shows advantages in applications where the harmonic balance based adjoint sensitivity analysis or finite difference approaches for sensitivity analysis perform poorly. In contrast to existing methods, the TFHA can be used in combination with arbitrary forward solvers, i.e. general transient solvers.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-09-12T16:36:22",
        "content": "In matched observational studies, the inferred causal conclusions pretending that matching has taken into account all confounding can be sensitive to unmeasured confounding. In such cases, a sensitivity analysis is often conducted, which investigates whether the observed association between treatment and outcome is due to effects caused by the treatment or it is due to hidden confounding. In general, a sensitivity analysis tries to infer the minimum amount of hidden biases needed in order to explain away the observed association between treatment and outcome, assuming that the treatment has no effect. If the needed bias is large, then the treatment is likely to have significant effects. The Rosenbaum sensitivity analysis is a modern approach for conducting sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies. It investigates what magnitude the maximum of the hidden biases from all matched sets needs to be in order to explain away the observed association, assuming that the treatment has no effect. However, such a sensitivity analysis can be overly conservative and pessimistic, especially when the investigators believe that some matched sets may have exceptionally large hidden biases. In this paper, we generalize Rosenbaum's framework to conduct sensitivity analysis on quantiles of hidden biases from all matched sets, which are more robust than the maximum. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis on all quantiles of hidden biases is simultaneously valid and is thus a free lunch added to the conventional sensitivity analysis. The proposed approach works for general outcomes, general matched studies and general test statistics. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis also works for bounded null hypotheses as long as the test statistic satisfies certain properties. An R package implementing the proposed method is also available online.",

It would be beneficial in various industrial sectors, including semiconductors and automobiles. Our research focused on low-energy plasmas in laboratory settings, and they were assessed via our proposed method, which incorporates relative entropy and fractional Brownian motion, based on a revised collisional-radiative model. By introducing an indicator to evaluate how far a system is from its steady state, both the trend of entropy and the radiative process' contribution to the lifetime of excited states were considered. The high statistical weight of some excited states may act as a bottleneck in the plasma's energy relaxation throughout the system to a steady state. By deepening our understanding of how energy flows through plasmas, we anticipate potential contributions to resolving global environmental issues and fostering technological innovation in plasma-related industrial fields.",

We study the special case of absence of symmetry induced by a group of scaling transformations of the continuous distribution of frequencies. When coupling between oscillators is increased beyond a critical threshold favoring spontaneous synchronization, we found that the variation in the velocity of the traveling wave depends on the extent of asymmetry in the natural frequency distribution. In particular for large coupling this velocity is the average natural frequency whereas at the onset of synchronization it corresponds to the frequency where the Hilbert Transform of the frequency distribution vanishes.",

        "content": "Matching is one of the most widely used study designs for adjusting for measured confounders in observational studies. However, unmeasured confounding may exist and cannot be removed by matching. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis is typically needed to assess a causal conclusion's sensitivity to unmeasured confounding. Sensitivity analysis frameworks for binary exposures have been well-established for various matching designs and are commonly used in various studies. However, unlike the binary exposure case, there still lacks valid and general sensitivity analysis methods for continuous exposures, except in some special cases such as pair matching. To fill this gap in the binary outcome case, we develop a sensitivity analysis framework for general matching designs with continuous exposures and binary outcomes. First, we use probabilistic lattice theory to show our sensitivity analysis approach is finite-population-exact under Fisher's sharp null. Second, we prove a novel design sensitivity formula as a powerful tool for asymptotically evaluating the performance of our sensitivity analysis approach. Third, to allow effect heterogeneity with binary outcomes, we introduce a framework for conducting asymptotically exact inference and sensitivity analysis on generalized attributable effects with binary outcomes via mixed-integer programming. Fourth, for the continuous outcomes case, we show that conducting an asymptotically exact sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies when both the exposures and outcomes are continuous is generally NP-hard, except in some special cases such as pair matching. As a real data application, we apply our new methods to study the effect of early-life lead exposure on juvenile delinquency. We also develop a publicly available R package for implementation of the methods in this work.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-03-21T05:57:43",
        "content": "In matched observational studies with binary treatments, the Rosenbaum bounds framework is arguably the most widely used sensitivity analysis framework for assessing sensitivity to unobserved covariates. Unlike the binary treatment case, although widely needed in practice, sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies with treatment doses (i.e., non-binary treatments such as ordinal treatments or continuous treatments) still lacks solid foundations and valid methodologies. We fill in this blank by establishing theoretical foundations and novel methodologies under a generalized Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis framework. First, we present a criterion for assessing the validity of sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies with treatment doses and use that criterion to justify the necessity of incorporating the treatment dose information into sensitivity analysis through generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds. We also generalize Rosenbaum's classic sensitivity parameter $\\Gamma$ to the non-binary treatment case and prove its sufficiency. Second, we study the asymptotic properties of sensitivity analysis by generalizing Rosenbaum's classic design sensitivity and Bahadur efficiency for testing Fisher's sharp null to the non-binary treatment case and deriving novel formulas for them. Our theoretical results showed the importance of appropriately incorporating the treatment dose into a test, which is an intrinsic distinction with the binary treatment case. Third, for testing Neyman's weak null (i.e., null sample average treatment effect), we propose the first valid sensitivity analysis procedure for matching with treatment dose through generalizing an existing optimization-based sensitivity analysis for the binary treatment case, built on the generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds and large-scale mixed integer programming.",

We study the special case of absence of symmetry induced by a group of scaling transformations of the continuous distribution of frequencies. When coupling between oscillators is increased beyond a critical threshold favoring spontaneous synchronization, we found that the variation in the velocity of the traveling wave depends on the extent of asymmetry in the natural frequency distribution. In particular for large coupling this velocity is the average natural frequency whereas at the onset of synchronization it corresponds to the frequency where the Hilbert Transform of the frequency distribution vanishes.",

The results illustrates that the incident wave can enhance the resonance response at the redistributed resonance frequency, which leads to an increase in radial acceleration and the secondary Bjerknes force, and rapid approach of bubbles. Furthermore, the influence of incident wave on the interaction of bubbles driven at lower frequencies is more significant, due to resonance enhancement caused by the proximity of natural frequencies and frequency multiplications of the external sound field. Our findings reveal that the compressible effect is not only critical to interaction in radial oscillations, but also in translational motion.",

As such, the entire natural frequency distribution must be accounted for, rather than just the shape at the center.

The time evolution is generated by N^{2} coupled differential equations for the matrix elements of U, and synchronization happens when U evolves into a multiple of the identity. The Ott-Antonsen ansatz is related to the Poisson kernels that are so useful in quantum transport, and we prove it in the case of identical natural frequencies. When the coupling constant is a matrix, we find some surprising new dynamical behaviors.",

        "content": "Synchronization among rhythmic elements is modeled by coupled phase-oscillators each of which has the so-called natural frequency. A symmetric natural frequency distribution induces a continuous or discontinuous synchronization transition from the nonsynchronized state, for instance. It has been numerically reported that asymmetry in the natural frequency distribution brings new types of bifurcation diagram having, in the order parameter, oscillation or a discontinuous jump which emerges from a partially synchronized state. We propose a theoretical classification method of five types of bifurcation diagrams including the new ones, paying attention to the generality of the theory. The oscillation and the jump from partially synchronized states are discussed respectively by the linear analysis around the nonsynchronized state and by extending the amplitude equation up to the third leading term. The theoretical classification is examined by comparing with numerically obtained one.",

It is well known that for a spring-mass system wherein the adjacent masses are linked through a spring, the natural frequency assignment can be achieved by choosing appropriate masses and spring stiffnesses if and only if the given positive eigenvalues are distinct. However, when we involve inerters, multiple eigenvalues in the assignment are allowed. In fact, arbitrarily given a set of positive real numbers, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition on the multiplicities of these numbers, which are assigned as the natural frequencies of the concerned mass-spring-inerter system.",

For this purpose, multi-objective charge system search algorithm in combination with multi-criteria tournament decision-making method is utilized. Concrete volume and natural frequencies of dam body are considered as two main objective functions. Numerical modeling and frequency analysis of dam-reservoir system are implemented by developing a parallel-working MATLAB-APDL code.

        "content": "Modeling the dynamic properties of wood and wood-based composites is a challenging task due to naturally growing structure and moisture-dependent material properties. This paper presents the finite element modeling of plywood panels' dynamic properties. Two panels differing in thickness were analyzed: (i) 18 mm and (ii) 27 mm. The developed models consisted of individual layers of wood, which were discretized using three-dimensional finite elements formulated using an orthotropic material model. The models were subjected to an updating procedure based on experimentally determined frequency response functions. As a result of a model updating relative errors for natural frequencies obtained numerically and experimentally were not exceeding 2.0%, on average 0.7% for 18 mm thick panel and not exceeding 2.6%, on average 1.5% for 27 mm thick panel. To prove the utility of the method and at the same time to validate it, a model of a cabinet was built, which was then subjected to experimental verification. In this case, average relative differences for natural frequencies of 6.6% were obtained.",

        "content": "Addressing the significant discrepancy between actual experimental cutting force and its predicted values derived from traditional constitutive model parameter identification methods, a reverse identification research of the Johnson-Cook (J-C) constitutive model for 304 stainless steel was conducted via genetic algorithm. Considering actual cutting zone and the influence of feed motion on the rake (flank) angle, an unequal division shear zone model was established to implement the theoretical calculation for shear zone stress. Through cutting experiments, the spindle speed was negatively correlated with the cutting force at first, and then became positively correlated; The empirical formula (EXP model) for turning force was corrected, revealing that the EXP model was unable to provide optimal predicted values for cutting force. The influence of the J-C constitutive parameter C on the cutting morphology was firstly investigated through simulation analysis, and determined an appropriate value for C, then obtained the precise values for the other four constitutive parameters by genetic algorithm. Moreover, the simulated values of cutting force in JC1 model (obtained from the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar test) and JCM model (the improved model using genetic algorithm) were obtained by three-dimensional (3-D) simulation via FEM software. The results indicated that, the maximum error between actual experimental cutting force and its simulated values (by JCM model) was 14.8%, with an average error of 6.38%. These results outperformed the JC1 and EXP models, suggesting that the JCM model identified via genetic algorithm was more reliable.",

        "publishedDate": "2021-06-11T15:59:33",
        "content": "For natural frequency optimization of engineering structures, cellular composites have been shown to possess an edge over solid. However, existing multiscale design methods for cellular composites are either computationally exhaustive or confined to a single class of microstructures. In this paper, we propose a data-driven topology optimization (TO) approach to enable the multiscale design of cellular structures with various choices of microstructure classes. The key component is a newly proposed latent-variable Gaussian process (LVGP) model through which different classes of microstructures are mapped into a low-dimensional continuous latent space. It provides an interpretable distance metric between classes and captures their effects on the homogenized stiffness tensors. By introducing latent vectors as design variables, a differentiable transition of stiffness matrix between classes can be easily achieved with an analytical gradient. After integrating LVGP with the density-based TO, an efficient data-driven cellular composite optimization process is developed to enable concurrent exploration of microstructure concepts and the associated volume fractions for natural frequency optimization. Examples reveal that the proposed cellular designs with multiclass microstructures achieve higher natural frequencies than both single-scale and single-class designs. This framework can be easily extended to other multi-scale TO problems, such as thermal compliance and dynamic response optimization.",

        "content": "The structural health monitoring (SHM) of buildings provides relevant data for the evaluation of the structural behavior over time, the efficiency of maintenance, strengthening, and post-earthquake conditions. This paper presents the design and implementation of a continuous SHM system based on dynamic properties, base accelerations, crack widths, out-of-plane rotations, and environmental data for the retrofitted church of Kuñotambo, a 17th century adobe structure, located in the Peruvian Andes. The system produces continuous hourly records. The organization, data collection, and processing of the SHM system follows different approaches and stages, concluding with the assessment of the structural and environmental conditions over time compared to predefined thresholds. The SHM system was implemented in May 2022 and is part of the Seismic Retrofitting Project of the Getty Conservation Institute. The initial results from the first twelve months of monitoring revealed seasonal fluctuations in crack widths, out-of-plane rotations, and natural frequencies, influenced by hygrothermal cycles, and an apparent positive trend, but more data are needed to justify the nature of these actions. This study emphasizes the necessity for extended data collection to establish robust correlations and refine monitoring strategies, aiming to enhance the longevity and safety of historic adobe structures under seismic risk.",

        "content": "The paper studies the topological changes from before and after cointegration, for the natural frequencies of the Z24 Bridge. The second natural frequency is known to be nonlinear in temperature, and this will serve as the main focal point of this work. Cointegration is a method of normalising time series data with respect to one another - often strongly-correlated time series. Cointegration is used in this paper to remove effects from Environmental and Operational Variations, by cointegrating the first four natural frequencies for the Z24 Bridge data. The temperature effects on the natural frequency data are clearly visible within the data, and it is desirable, for the purposes of structural health monitoring, that these effects are removed. The univariate time series are embedded in higher-dimensional space, such that interesting topologies are formed. Topological data analysis is used to analyse the raw time series, and the cointegrated equivalents. A standard topological data analysis pipeline is enacted, where simplicial complexes are constructed from the embedded point clouds. Topological properties are then calculated from the simplicial complexes; such as the persistent homology. The persistent homology is then analysed, to determine the topological structure of all the time series.",

        "content": "A full triangular chiral (Tri-Chi) honeycomb, combining a honeycomb structure with triangular chiral configuration, notably impacts the Poisson's ratio (PR) and stiffness. To assess the random vibration properties of a composite sandwich panel with a Tri-Chi honeycomb core (CSP-TCH), a two-dimensional equivalent Reissner-Mindlin model (2D-ERM) was created using the variational asymptotic method. The precision of the 2D-ERM in free and random vibration analysis was confirmed through numerical simulations employing 3D finite element analysis, encompassing PSD curves and RMS responses. Furthermore, the effects of selecting the model class were quantified through dynamic numerical examples. Modal analysis revealed that the relative error of the first eight natural frequencies predicted by the 2D-ERM consistently remained below 7%, with the modal cloud demonstrating high reliability. The PSD curves and their RMS values closely aligned with 3D finite element results under various boundary conditions, with a maximum error below 5%. Key factors influencing the vibration characteristics included the ligament-rib angle of the core layer and layup modes of the composite facesheets, while the rib-to-ligament thickness ratio and the aspect ratio exert minimal influence. The impact of the ligament-rib angle on the vibration properties primarily stems from the significant shift in the core layer's Poisson's ratio, transitioning from negative to positive. These findings offer a rapid and precise approach for optimizing the vibration design of CSP-TCH.",

        "content": "The multidimensional Kuramoto model describes the synchronization dynamics of particles moving on the surface of D-dimensional spheres, generalizing the original model where particles were characterized by a single phase. In this setup, particles are more easily represented by $D$-dimensional unit vectors than by $D-1$ spherical angles, allowing for the coupling constant to be extended to a coupling matrix acting on the vectors. As in the original Kuramoto model, each particle has a set of $D(D-1)/2$ natural frequencies, drawn from a distribution. The system has a large number of independent parameters, given by the average natural frequencies, the characteristic widths of their distributions plus $D^2$ constants of the coupling matrix. General phase diagrams, indicating regions in parameter space where the system exhibits different behaviors, are hard to derive analytically. Here we obtain the complete phase diagram for $D=2$ and Lorentzian distributions of natural frequencies using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz. We also explore the diagrams numerically for different distributions and some specific choices of parameters for $D=2$, $D=3$ and $D=4$. In all cases the system exhibits at most four different phases: disordered, static synchrony, rotation and active synchrony. Existence of specific phases and boundaries between them depend strongly on the dimension $D$, the coupling matrix and the distribution of natural frequencies.",

        "content": "In this study, a numerical dynamic analysis of ceiling raster panels was performed. The analysis was conducted on panels designed with inspiration from bionics. The purpose of the analysis was to enable optimisation of the location of the holes in the designed slabs in order to achieve the preferred dynamic properties, including the natural frequencies of the slabs and an appropriate airflow to avoid the occurrence of resonance. Three different types of panels were used and a total of fifteen panels were designed in terms of their geometry, with circular, elliptical, and hexagonal perforations, made of different materials: polypropylene PP, wood, and aluminium. Then, using the finite element method and ANSYS 2023 R1 software, the airflow over the ceiling panels and their natural frequencies and vibration modes were analysed. The analysis took into account not only the shape of the openings, but also their percentage area relative to the total panel area and different airflow velocities. In addition, the results were compared in an analytical way with those obtained for a solid slab. The results obtained include findings on the mode shapes and values of the vibration frequencies of the plates, air pressure maps, histograms, and plots of the pressure dependence on the surface area of the plate openings.",

        "content": "We study synchronization patterns in repulsively coupled Kuramoto oscillators and focus on the impact of disorder in the natural frequencies. Among other choices we select the grid size and topology in a way that we observe a dynamically induced dimensional reduction with a continuum of attractors as long as the natural frequencies are uniformly chosen. When we introduce disorder in these frequencies, we find limit cycles with periods that are orders of magnitude longer than the natural frequencies of individual oscillators. Moreover we identify sequences of temporary patterns of phase-locked motion, which are self-similar in time and whose periods scale with a power of the inverse width about a uniform frequency distribution. This behavior provides challenges for future research.",

        "title": "Branch spiral beam harvester for uni-directional ultra-low frequency excitations.",
        "content": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in piezoelectric energy harvesting systems, particularly for their potential to recharge or replace batteries in energy-efficient electronic devices and wireless sensor networks. Nonetheless, the conventional linear piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEH) face limitations in ultra-low frequency vibrations (1-10 Hz) due to their narrow operating bandwidth and higher resonance frequencies. To address this, researchers explored compact shaped geometries, with spiral PEH being one such design to lower resonance frequencies by reducing structural stiffness. While trying to achieve this lower resonance frequency, spiral designs overlooked that they were spreading the stress across the structure. This was a significant drawback because it reduced the structure's ability to stress the piezoelectric transducer. The issue remains unaddressed, limiting the power generation of spiral beam harvesters. Furthermore, spiral structures also fail to broaden the operating bandwidth, posing additional constraints on their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel solution - the \"branch spiral beam harvester,\" combining the benefits of both spiral and branch beam designs. The integration of the branch beam concept into the spiral structure aimed to broaden the effective frequency range and establish a concentrated stress area for the placement of the piezoelectric transducer. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was employed to assess operating bandwidth and stress distribution, while experimental studies evaluated voltage and power generation. Once the workability was confirmed, a statistical optimisation method was introduced to tailor the harvester for specific frequencies in the ultra-low frequency range. Results indicated that the branch spiral beam harvester exhibits a wider operating bandwidth with six natural frequencies in the ultra-low frequency range. It harnessed significantly higher output voltages and power compared to conventional linear PEH. This innovation presents a promising advancement in piezoelectric energy harvesting, offering improved performance without the need for proof masses or additional accessories.",

Modal parameters of the ambient vibration structures consist of natural frequencies, mode shapes, and modal damping ratios. In this paper, a typical frame with arbitrary loading has been modeled in finite element software, ANSYS, and the responses (accelerations of nodes) have been achieved. By using these data and the codes written in MATLAB, the modal parameters (natural frequencies, mode shapes) of the beams are identified with FDD (Frequency Domain Decomposition) and PP (Peak Picking) methods and then justified with the results of input-output method which was determined by modal analysis. The results indicate that there is a good agreement between three methods for determining the dynamic characteristics of frames. Then, the minimum number of required accelerometer has been determined that recording the acceleration in that location leads to identifying all the natural frequencies of the frame.",

This review summarizes different biomass carbon structures and their preparation methods and explores the applications of these materials in electrochemical sensors. Modification of biomass carbon materials through pretreatment, physical and chemical activation, heteroatom doping, metal compound composite and other methods can make up for the deficiencies in its pore structure, electrical conductivity and surface wettability, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. The effects of different biomass sources, functional groups, constituent elements and modification methods on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are discussed, and the applications of this type of material in biological molecules, heavy metal ions and pesticide residues are reviewed. Biomass carbon-based materials show great application potential and development prospects in the field of electrochemical sensors.",

        "content": "The paper studies the topological changes from before and after cointegration, for the natural frequencies of the Z24 Bridge. The second natural frequency is known to be nonlinear in temperature, and this will serve as the main focal point of this work. Cointegration is a method of normalising time series data with respect to one another - often strongly-correlated time series. Cointegration is used in this paper to remove effects from Environmental and Operational Variations, by cointegrating the first four natural frequencies for the Z24 Bridge data. The temperature effects on the natural frequency data are clearly visible within the data, and it is desirable, for the purposes of structural health monitoring, that these effects are removed. The univariate time series are embedded in higher-dimensional space, such that interesting topologies are formed. Topological data analysis is used to analyse the raw time series, and the cointegrated equivalents. A standard topological data analysis pipeline is enacted, where simplicial complexes are constructed from the embedded point clouds. Topological properties are then calculated from the simplicial complexes; such as the persistent homology. The persistent homology is then analysed, to determine the topological structure of all the time series.",

        "content": "Significant advancements in hydrogel-based epidermal electrodes have been made in recent years. However, inherent limitations, such as adaptability, adhesion, and conductivity, have presented challenges, thereby limiting the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stability of the physiological-electrode interface. In this study, we propose the concept of myelin sheath-inspired hydrogel epidermal electronics by incorporating numerous interpenetrating core-sheath-structured conductive nanofibers within a physically cross-linked polyelectrolyte network. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated sulfonated cellulose nanofibers (PEDOT:SCNFs) are synthesized through a simple solvent-catalyzed sulfonation process, followed by oxidative self-polymerization and ionic liquid (IL) shielding steps, achieving a low electrochemical impedance of 42 Ω. The physical associations within the composite hydrogel network include complexation, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction, and weak entanglements. These properties confer the hydrogel with high stretchability (770%), superconformability, self-adhesion (28 kPa on pigskin), and self-healing capabilities. By simulating the saltatory propagation effect of the nodes of Ranvier in the nervous system, the biomimetic hydrogel establishes high-fidelity epidermal electronic interfaces, offering benefits such as low interfacial contact impedance, significantly increased SNR (30 dB), as well as large-scale sensor array integration. The advanced biomimetic hydrogel holds tremendous potential for applications in electronic skin (e-skin), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and healthcare assessment devices.",

        "content": "Globally coupled ensembles of phase oscillators serve as useful tools for modeling synchronization and collective behavior in a variety of applications. As interest in the effects of simplicial interactions (i.e., non-additive, higher-order interactions between three or more units) continues to grow we study an extension of the Kuramoto model where oscillators are coupled via three-way interactions that exhibits novel dynamical properties including clustering, multistability, and abrupt desynchronization transitions. Here we provide a rigorous description of the stability of various multicluster states by studying their spectral properties in the thermodynamic limit. Not unlike the classical Kuramoto model, a natural frequency distribution with infinite support yields a population of drifting oscillators, which in turn guarantees that a portion of the spectrum is located on the imaginary axes, resulting in neutrally stable or unstable solutions. On the other hand, a natural frequency distribution with finite support allows for a fully phase-locked state, whose spectrum is real and may be linearly stable or unstable.",

        "title": "Deterministic fabrication of graphene hexagonal boron nitride moiré superlattices.",
        "content": "The electronic properties of moiré heterostructures depend sensitively on the relative orientation between layers of the stack. For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a [Formula: see text] ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near-[Formula: see text], not [Formula: see text], relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy of the graphene/hBN moiré on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, nonaligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moiré heterostructures.",

        "publishedDate": "2019-04-01T17:06:54",
        "content": "Synchronization of network-coupled dynamical units is important to a variety of natural and engineered processes including circadian rhythms, cardiac function, neural processing, and power grids. Despite this ubiquity, it remains poorly understood how complex network structures and heterogeneous local dynamics combine to either promote or inhibit synchronization. Moreover, for most real-world applications it is impossible to obtain the exact specifications of the system, and there is a lack of theory for how uncertainty affects synchronization. We address this open problem by studying the Synchrony Alignment Function (SAF), which is an objective measure for the synchronization properties of a network of heterogeneous oscillators with given natural frequencies. We extend the SAF framework to analyze network-coupled oscillators with heterogeneous natural frequencies that are drawn as a multivariate random vector. Using probability theory for quadratic forms, we obtain expressions for the expectation and variance of the SAF for given network structures. We conclude with numerical experiments that illustrate how the incorporation of uncertainty yields a more robust theoretical framework for enhancing synchronization, and we provide new perspectives for why synchronization is generically promoted by network properties including degree-frequency correlations, link directedness, and link weight delocalization.",

        "content": "Cow milk (CM) is an important food source for humans, and food allergy caused by CM has attracted attention worldwide. To our knowledge, systematic studies about the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of CM are very rare. In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, and P. pentosaceus fermentation on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability was determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the protein quality, amino acid profile, and color were systematically evaluated. The results showed that these LAB strains exhibited higher protein degradation ability, and the IgE reactivity reduction rate was 41.03%-60.00% and the IgG reduction rate was 29.86%-67.20%, respectively. Additionally, the nutritional value was improved obviously, and the color was altered significantly, which was conductive to develop dairy products. These findings provided a theoretical foundation for the development of hypoallergenic dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus could be considered as good potential candidates for solving cow milk allergy owing to their decreased IgE/IgG binding ability andimproved nutritional and sensory properties, which provide a promising strategy to develop hypoallergenic dairy products.",

        "content": "Efficient and accurate numerical algorithms are developed to solve a generalized Kirchhoff-Love plate model subject to three common physical boundary conditions: (i) clamped; (ii) simply supported; and (iii) free. We solve the model equation by discretizing the spatial derivatives using second-order finite-difference schemes, and then advancing the semi-discrete problem in time with either an explicit predictor-corrector or an implicit Newmark-Beta time-stepping algorithm. Stability analysis is conducted for the schemes and the results are used to determine stable time steps in practice. A series of carefully chosen test problems are solved to demonstrate the properties and applications of our numerical approaches. The numerical results confirm the stability and 2nd-order accuracy of the algorithms, and are also comparable with experiments for similar thin plates. As an application, we illustrate a strategy to identify the natural frequencies of a plate using our numerical methods in conjunction with a fast Fourier transformation (FFT) power spectrum analysis of the computed data. Then we take advantage of one of the computed natural frequencies to simulate the interesting physical phenomena known as resonance and beat for a generalized Kirchhoff-Love plate.",

Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report here a visible-light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls, though a Norrish type II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction with various non-volatile electron-rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocabonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides, as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1-acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer-based mechanism is proposed.",

        "content": "In this paper, we present a theory of six classes of vibrators with variable-order fractional forces of inertia, damping, and restoration. The novelty and contributions of the present theory are reflected in six aspects. 1) Equivalent motion equations of those variable-order fractional vibrators are proposed. 2) The analytical expressions of the effective mass, damping, and stiffness of those variable-order fractional vibrators are presented. 3) The asymptotic properties of the effective mass, damping, and stiffness of a class of variable-order fractional vibrators are given. 4) The restricted effective parameters (damping ratio, damping free natural frequency, damped natural frequency, frequency ratio) of the variable-order fractional vibrators are put forward. 5) We bring forward the analytical representations of the free responses, the impulse responses, and the frequency transfer functions of those variable-order fractional vibrators. 6) We propose a solution to an open problem of how to mathematically explain the Rayleigh damping assumption based on the present theory of variable-order fractional vibrations.",

        "content": "In this contribution, we describe the various research domains in which RuII alkynyl derivatives are involved. Their peculiar molecular properties stem from a strong and intimate overlap between the metal centered d orbitals and the p system of the acetylide ligands, resulting in plethora of fascinating properties such as strong and tunable visible light absorption with a strong MLCT character essential for sensing, photovoltaics, light-harvesting applications or non-linear optical properties. Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices. Altogether, we show in this review the potential of RuII acetylide compounds, insisting on the molecular design and suggesting further research developments for this class of organometallic dyes, including supramolecular chemistry.",

        "content": "This paper introduces a novel design method that enhances the force/torque, bendability, and controllability of soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs). The complex structure of the soft actuator is simplified by approximating it as a cantilever beam. This allows us to derive approximated nonlinear kinematic models and a dynamical model, which is explored to understand the correlation between natural frequency and dimensional parameters of SPA. The design problem is then transformed into an optimization problem, using kinematic equations as the objective function and the dynamical equation as a constraint. By solving this optimization problem, the optimal dimensional parameters are determined. Six prototypes are manufactured to validate the proposed approach. The optimal actuator successfully generates the desired force/torque and bending angle, while its natural frequency remains within the constrained range. This work highlights the potential of using optimization formulation and approximated nonlinear models to boost the performance and dynamical properties of soft pneumatic actuators.",

        "content": "Self-assembled polymer grafted nanoparticles (PGNs) are of great interest for their potential to enhance mechanical properties compared to neat polymers and nanocomposites. Apart from volume fraction of nanoparticles, recent experiments have suggested that nanoscale phenomena such as nanoconfinement of grafted chains, altered dynamics and relaxation behavior at the segmental and colloidal scales, and cohesive energy between neighboring coronas are important factors that influence mechanical and rheological properties. How these factors influence the mechanics of thin films subject to micro-ballistic impact remains to be fully understood. Here we examine the micro-ballistic impact resistance of PGN thin films with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grafts using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The grafted chain length and nanoparticle core densities are systematically varied to understand the influences of interparticle spacing, cohesion, and momentum transfer effects under high-velocity impact. Our findings show that the inter-PGN cohesive energy density (",

        "publishedDate": "2024-08-16T11:11:56",
        "content": "In the field of operational modal analysis (OMA), obtained modal information is frequently used to assess the current state of aerospace, mechanical, offshore and civil structures. However, the stochasticity of operational systems and the lack of forcing information can lead to inconsistent results. Quantifying the uncertainty of the recovered modal parameters through OMA is therefore of significant value. In this article, a new perspective on Bayesian OMA is proposed: a Bayesian stochastic subspace identification (SSI) algorithm. Distinct from existing approaches to Bayesian OMA, a hierarchical probabilistic model is embedded at the core of covariance-driven SSI. Through substitution of canonical correlation analysis with a Bayesian equivalent, posterior distributions over the modal properties are obtained. Two inference schemes are presented for the proposed Bayesian formulation: Markov Chain Monte Carlo and variational Bayes. Two case studies are then explored. The first is benchmark study using data from a simulated, multi degree-of-freedom, linear system. Following application of Bayesian SSI, it is shown that the same posterior is targeted and recovered by both inference schemes, with good agreement between the posterior mean and the conventional SSI result. The second study applies the variational form to data obtained from an in-service structure: The Z24 bridge. The results of this study are presented at single model orders, and then using a stabilisation diagram. The recovered posterior uncertainty is presented and compared to the classic SSI result. It is observed that the posterior distributions with mean values coinciding with the natural frequencies exhibit lower variance than values situated away from the natural frequencies.",

        "content": "Studies in the existing literature propose that allocryptopine possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showcasing its neuroprotective effects by potentially mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aims to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of allocryptopine on various targets and potential mechanisms that have not been previously explored in the literature. Initially, we used MTT and LDH methods to evaluate the effects of allocryptopine on cell viability in BV-2 cells exposed to LPS-induced damage. Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), other inflammatory mediators (Cox-2 and iNOS), and p38 MAPK genes and proteins through qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Also, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on NF-κB proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p-p50, and p-p65) through ELISA assay. Molecular docking analyses were performed to investigate the potential binding of allocryptopine to target proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p50, p65, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, p38, AP-1 (c-Jun and ATF2), IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Cox-2, and iNOS) associated with the TLR4, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK pathways. Our results indicate that allocryptopine exerts a comprehensive influence on pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and modulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. The outcomes of our study suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy of allocryptopine is intricately linked to the modulation of key molecular pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of allocryptopine as a therapeutic agent for addressing neurodegenerative diseases by safeguarding neuronal health.",

Mechanical properties of parts manufactured using FDM are influenced by different process parameters involved during manufacturing as they impact the bonding among different layers of cross-section. In this study, the effect of infill patterns and build orientations on the mechanical properties of PLA based parts manufactured using FDM method is studied. Six different infill patterns (triangles, cubic, concentric, tetrahedral, lines, and zigzag) and three different orientations (flatwise, edgewise, and upright) are considered for rectangular beam type parts. For determining mechanical properties of parts with different infill patterns and orientations, flexural bending test is performed. Experimental modal analysis of manufactured parts is performed to observe the relation of natural frequencies with elastic modulus of the parts obtained from flexural bending test. The possibility of experimental modal analysis as an alternative non-destructive method for testing mechanical properties of FDM 3D printed parts is explored.",

Sensitivity analysis assesses how input changes affect the output, constituting a key component of interpretation. Among the post-hoc interpretation methods such as back-propagation, perturbation, and approximation, my work will investigate perturbation-based sensitivity Analysis methods on modern Transformer models to benchmark their performances. Specifically, my work answers three research questions: 1) Do different sensitivity analysis (SA) methods yield comparable outputs and attribute importance rankings? 2) Using the same sensitivity analysis method, do different Deep Learning (DL) models impact the output of the sensitivity analysis? 3) How well do the results from sensitivity analysis methods align with the ground truth?",

        "content": "Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a Class C infectious disease that carries particularly high risk for preschool children and is a leading cause of childhood death in some countries. We mimic the periodic outbreak of HFMD over a 2-year period-with differing amplitudes-and propose a dynamic HFMD model that differentiates transmission between mature and immature individuals and uses two possible optimal-control strategies to minimize case numbers, total costs and deaths. We parameterized the model by fitting it to HFMD data in mainland China from January 2011 to December 2018, and the basic reproduction number was estimated as 0.9599. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that transmission between immature and mature individuals contributes substantially to new infections. Increasing the isolation rates of infectious individuals-particularly mature infectious individuals-could greatly reduce the outbreak risk and potentially eradicate the disease in a relatively short time period. It follows that we have a reasonable chance of controlling HFMD if we can reduce transmission in children under 7 and isolate older infectious individuals.",

For a given counterfactual policy, we obtain identified sets for the effect of both marginal and global changes in the proportion of treated individuals. To conduct a sensitivity analysis, we introduce the quantile breakdown frontier, a curve that (i) indicates whether a sensitivity analysis is possible or not, and (ii) when a sensitivity analysis is possible, quantifies the amount of selection bias consistent with a given conclusion of interest across different quantiles. To illustrate our method, we perform a sensitivity analysis on the effect of unionizing low income workers on the quantiles of the distribution of (log) wages.",

This study is a preliminary evaluation of graded exposure therapy (GET), which directly targets fear avoidance behaviour, for reducing post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and disability following mTBI. In a historical comparison design, we compared two groups from independent randomized trials. The GET + UC group (N = 34) received GET (delivered over 16 videoconference sessions) in addition to usual care (UC). The historical comparison group (N = 71) received UC only. PCS severity (Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire; RPQ) and disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule; WHODAS 2.0 12-item) were measured at clinic intake (M = 2.7, SD = 1.1 months after injury) and again at M = 4.9 (SD = 1.1) months after injury. Between-group differences were estimated using linear mixed effects regression, with a sensitivity analysis controlling for injury-to-assessment intervals. The estimated average change on the RPQ was -14.3 in the GET + UC group and -5.3 in the UC group. The estimated average change on the WHODAS was -5.3 in the GET + UC group and -3.2 in the UC group. Between-group differences post-treatment were -5.3 on the RPQ and -1.5 on the WHODAS. Treatment effects were larger in sensitivity analyses. Findings suggest that a randomized controlled trial is warranted.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-09-12T16:36:22",
        "content": "In matched observational studies, the inferred causal conclusions pretending that matching has taken into account all confounding can be sensitive to unmeasured confounding. In such cases, a sensitivity analysis is often conducted, which investigates whether the observed association between treatment and outcome is due to effects caused by the treatment or it is due to hidden confounding. In general, a sensitivity analysis tries to infer the minimum amount of hidden biases needed in order to explain away the observed association between treatment and outcome, assuming that the treatment has no effect. If the needed bias is large, then the treatment is likely to have significant effects. The Rosenbaum sensitivity analysis is a modern approach for conducting sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies. It investigates what magnitude the maximum of the hidden biases from all matched sets needs to be in order to explain away the observed association, assuming that the treatment has no effect. However, such a sensitivity analysis can be overly conservative and pessimistic, especially when the investigators believe that some matched sets may have exceptionally large hidden biases. In this paper, we generalize Rosenbaum's framework to conduct sensitivity analysis on quantiles of hidden biases from all matched sets, which are more robust than the maximum. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis on all quantiles of hidden biases is simultaneously valid and is thus a free lunch added to the conventional sensitivity analysis. The proposed approach works for general outcomes, general matched studies and general test statistics. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis also works for bounded null hypotheses as long as the test statistic satisfies certain properties. An R package implementing the proposed method is also available online.",

        "content": "A highly versatile evaluation method is proposed for transient plasmas based on statistical physics. It would be beneficial in various industrial sectors, including semiconductors and automobiles. Our research focused on low-energy plasmas in laboratory settings, and they were assessed via our proposed method, which incorporates relative entropy and fractional Brownian motion, based on a revised collisional-radiative model. By introducing an indicator to evaluate how far a system is from its steady state, both the trend of entropy and the radiative process' contribution to the lifetime of excited states were considered. The high statistical weight of some excited states may act as a bottleneck in the plasma's energy relaxation throughout the system to a steady state. By deepening our understanding of how energy flows through plasmas, we anticipate potential contributions to resolving global environmental issues and fostering technological innovation in plasma-related industrial fields.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-01-12T21:49:25",
        "content": "Matching is one of the most widely used study designs for adjusting for measured confounders in observational studies. However, unmeasured confounding may exist and cannot be removed by matching. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis is typically needed to assess a causal conclusion's sensitivity to unmeasured confounding. Sensitivity analysis frameworks for binary exposures have been well-established for various matching designs and are commonly used in various studies. However, unlike the binary exposure case, there still lacks valid and general sensitivity analysis methods for continuous exposures, except in some special cases such as pair matching. To fill this gap in the binary outcome case, we develop a sensitivity analysis framework for general matching designs with continuous exposures and binary outcomes. First, we use probabilistic lattice theory to show our sensitivity analysis approach is finite-population-exact under Fisher's sharp null. Second, we prove a novel design sensitivity formula as a powerful tool for asymptotically evaluating the performance of our sensitivity analysis approach. Third, to allow effect heterogeneity with binary outcomes, we introduce a framework for conducting asymptotically exact inference and sensitivity analysis on generalized attributable effects with binary outcomes via mixed-integer programming. Fourth, for the continuous outcomes case, we show that conducting an asymptotically exact sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies when both the exposures and outcomes are continuous is generally NP-hard, except in some special cases such as pair matching. As a real data application, we apply our new methods to study the effect of early-life lead exposure on juvenile delinquency. We also develop a publicly available R package for implementation of the methods in this work.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-03-21T05:57:43",
        "content": "In matched observational studies with binary treatments, the Rosenbaum bounds framework is arguably the most widely used sensitivity analysis framework for assessing sensitivity to unobserved covariates. Unlike the binary treatment case, although widely needed in practice, sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies with treatment doses (i.e., non-binary treatments such as ordinal treatments or continuous treatments) still lacks solid foundations and valid methodologies. We fill in this blank by establishing theoretical foundations and novel methodologies under a generalized Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis framework. First, we present a criterion for assessing the validity of sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies with treatment doses and use that criterion to justify the necessity of incorporating the treatment dose information into sensitivity analysis through generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds. We also generalize Rosenbaum's classic sensitivity parameter $\\Gamma$ to the non-binary treatment case and prove its sufficiency. Second, we study the asymptotic properties of sensitivity analysis by generalizing Rosenbaum's classic design sensitivity and Bahadur efficiency for testing Fisher's sharp null to the non-binary treatment case and deriving novel formulas for them. Our theoretical results showed the importance of appropriately incorporating the treatment dose into a test, which is an intrinsic distinction with the binary treatment case. Third, for testing Neyman's weak null (i.e., null sample average treatment effect), we propose the first valid sensitivity analysis procedure for matching with treatment dose through generalizing an existing optimization-based sensitivity analysis for the binary treatment case, built on the generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds and large-scale mixed integer programming.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-09-12T16:36:22",
        "content": "In matched observational studies, the inferred causal conclusions pretending that matching has taken into account all confounding can be sensitive to unmeasured confounding. In such cases, a sensitivity analysis is often conducted, which investigates whether the observed association between treatment and outcome is due to effects caused by the treatment or it is due to hidden confounding. In general, a sensitivity analysis tries to infer the minimum amount of hidden biases needed in order to explain away the observed association between treatment and outcome, assuming that the treatment has no effect. If the needed bias is large, then the treatment is likely to have significant effects. The Rosenbaum sensitivity analysis is a modern approach for conducting sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies. It investigates what magnitude the maximum of the hidden biases from all matched sets needs to be in order to explain away the observed association, assuming that the treatment has no effect. However, such a sensitivity analysis can be overly conservative and pessimistic, especially when the investigators believe that some matched sets may have exceptionally large hidden biases. In this paper, we generalize Rosenbaum's framework to conduct sensitivity analysis on quantiles of hidden biases from all matched sets, which are more robust than the maximum. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis on all quantiles of hidden biases is simultaneously valid and is thus a free lunch added to the conventional sensitivity analysis. The proposed approach works for general outcomes, general matched studies and general test statistics. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis also works for bounded null hypotheses as long as the test statistic satisfies certain properties. An R package implementing the proposed method is also available online.",

        "content": "In recent years, biomass carbon materials have received widespread attention in the field of electrochemical sensors. As a new type of renewable green energy, biomass carbon has the advantages of low cost and abundant resources. After special treatment, it can be used as an ideal electrode material. Since biomass carbon materials have diverse sources and their morphology is difficult to control, researchers have conducted in-depth research on their preparation process, morphology regulation and application. This review summarizes different biomass carbon structures and their preparation methods and explores the applications of these materials in electrochemical sensors. Modification of biomass carbon materials through pretreatment, physical and chemical activation, heteroatom doping, metal compound composite and other methods can make up for the deficiencies in its pore structure, electrical conductivity and surface wettability, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. The effects of different biomass sources, functional groups, constituent elements and modification methods on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are discussed, and the applications of this type of material in biological molecules, heavy metal ions and pesticide residues are reviewed. Biomass carbon-based materials show great application potential and development prospects in the field of electrochemical sensors.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-03-21T05:57:43",
        "content": "In matched observational studies with binary treatments, the Rosenbaum bounds framework is arguably the most widely used sensitivity analysis framework for assessing sensitivity to unobserved covariates. Unlike the binary treatment case, although widely needed in practice, sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies with treatment doses (i.e., non-binary treatments such as ordinal treatments or continuous treatments) still lacks solid foundations and valid methodologies. We fill in this blank by establishing theoretical foundations and novel methodologies under a generalized Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis framework. First, we present a criterion for assessing the validity of sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies with treatment doses and use that criterion to justify the necessity of incorporating the treatment dose information into sensitivity analysis through generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds. We also generalize Rosenbaum's classic sensitivity parameter $\\Gamma$ to the non-binary treatment case and prove its sufficiency. Second, we study the asymptotic properties of sensitivity analysis by generalizing Rosenbaum's classic design sensitivity and Bahadur efficiency for testing Fisher's sharp null to the non-binary treatment case and deriving novel formulas for them. Our theoretical results showed the importance of appropriately incorporating the treatment dose into a test, which is an intrinsic distinction with the binary treatment case. Third, for testing Neyman's weak null (i.e., null sample average treatment effect), we propose the first valid sensitivity analysis procedure for matching with treatment dose through generalizing an existing optimization-based sensitivity analysis for the binary treatment case, built on the generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds and large-scale mixed integer programming.",

        "content": "Significant advancements in hydrogel-based epidermal electrodes have been made in recent years. However, inherent limitations, such as adaptability, adhesion, and conductivity, have presented challenges, thereby limiting the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stability of the physiological-electrode interface. In this study, we propose the concept of myelin sheath-inspired hydrogel epidermal electronics by incorporating numerous interpenetrating core-sheath-structured conductive nanofibers within a physically cross-linked polyelectrolyte network. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated sulfonated cellulose nanofibers (PEDOT:SCNFs) are synthesized through a simple solvent-catalyzed sulfonation process, followed by oxidative self-polymerization and ionic liquid (IL) shielding steps, achieving a low electrochemical impedance of 42 Ω. The physical associations within the composite hydrogel network include complexation, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction, and weak entanglements. These properties confer the hydrogel with high stretchability (770%), superconformability, self-adhesion (28 kPa on pigskin), and self-healing capabilities. By simulating the saltatory propagation effect of the nodes of Ranvier in the nervous system, the biomimetic hydrogel establishes high-fidelity epidermal electronic interfaces, offering benefits such as low interfacial contact impedance, significantly increased SNR (30 dB), as well as large-scale sensor array integration. The advanced biomimetic hydrogel holds tremendous potential for applications in electronic skin (e-skin), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and healthcare assessment devices.",

        "content": "The sensitivity analysis of biological system models can significantly contribute to identifying and explaining influences of internal or external changes on model and its elements. We propose here a comprehensive framework to study sensitivity of intra-cellular networks and to identify key intervention pathways, by performing both static and dynamic sensitivity analysis. While the static sensitivity analysis focuses on the impact of network topology and update functions, the dynamic analysis accounts for context-dependent transient state distributions. To study sensitivity, we use discrete models, where each element is represented as a discrete variable and assigned an update rule, which is a function of element's known direct and indirect regulators. Our sensitivity analysis framework allows for assessing the effect of context on individual element sensitivity, as well as on element criticality in reaching preferred outcomes. The framework also enables discovery of most influential pathways in the model that are essential for satisfying important system properties, and thus, could be used for interventions. We discuss the role of nine different network attributes in identifying key elements and intervention pathways, and evaluate their performance using model checking method. Finally, we apply our methods on the model of naive T cell differentiation, and further demonstrate the importance of context-based sensitivity analysis in identifying most influential elements and pathways.",

        "content": "The electronic properties of moiré heterostructures depend sensitively on the relative orientation between layers of the stack. For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a [Formula: see text] ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near-[Formula: see text], not [Formula: see text], relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy of the graphene/hBN moiré on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, nonaligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moiré heterostructures.",

To our knowledge, systematic studies about the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of CM are very rare. In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, and P. pentosaceus fermentation on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability was determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the protein quality, amino acid profile, and color were systematically evaluated. The results showed that these LAB strains exhibited higher protein degradation ability, and the IgE reactivity reduction rate was 41.03%-60.00% and the IgG reduction rate was 29.86%-67.20%, respectively. Additionally, the nutritional value was improved obviously, and the color was altered significantly, which was conductive to develop dairy products. These findings provided a theoretical foundation for the development of hypoallergenic dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus could be considered as good potential candidates for solving cow milk allergy owing to their decreased IgE/IgG binding ability andimproved nutritional and sensory properties, which provide a promising strategy to develop hypoallergenic dairy products.",

The model combines the particle dynamics simulator F-TRIDYN, that predicts the helium implantation profile, with the cluster dynamics simulator Xolotl, that predicts the growth and evolution of subsurface helium gas bubbles. In order to keep the sensitivity analysis tractable, we first construct a sparse, high-dimensional polynomial chaos expansion surrogate model for each output quantity of interest, which allows the efficient extraction of sensitivity information. The sensitivity analysis is performed for two problem settings: one for ITER-like conditions, and one that resembles conditions inside the PISCES-A linear plasma device.

Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report here a visible-light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls, though a Norrish type II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction with various non-volatile electron-rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocabonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides, as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1-acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer-based mechanism is proposed.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-05-16T08:20:26",
        "content": "In this paper, we aim to perform sensitivity analysis of set-valued models and, in particular, to quantify the impact of uncertain inputs on feasible sets, which are key elements in solving a robust optimization problem under constraints. While most sensitivity analysis methods deal with scalar outputs, this paper introduces a novel approach for performing sensitivity analysis with set-valued outputs. Our innovative methodology is designed for excursion sets, but is versatile enough to be applied to set-valued simulators, including those found in viability fields, or when working with maps like pollutant concentration maps or flood zone maps. We propose to use the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) with a kernel designed for set-valued outputs. After proposing a probabilistic framework for random sets, a first contribution is the proof that this kernel is characteristic, an essential property in a kernel-based sensitivity analysis context. To measure the contribution of each input, we then propose to use HSIC-ANOVA indices. With these indices, we can identify which inputs should be neglected (screening) and we can rank the others according to their influence (ranking). The estimation of these indices is also adapted to the set-valued outputs. Finally, we test the proposed method on three test cases of excursion sets.",

Their peculiar molecular properties stem from a strong and intimate overlap between the metal centered d orbitals and the p system of the acetylide ligands, resulting in plethora of fascinating properties such as strong and tunable visible light absorption with a strong MLCT character essential for sensing, photovoltaics, light-harvesting applications or non-linear optical properties. Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices. Altogether, we show in this review the potential of RuII acetylide compounds, insisting on the molecular design and suggesting further research developments for this class of organometallic dyes, including supramolecular chemistry.",

        "content": "In the analysis of prognosis studies with time-to-event outcomes, dichotomization of patients is often made. As the evaluations of prognostic capacity, the survivals of groups with high/low expression of the biomarker are often estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference between groups is summarized via the hazard ratio (HR). The high/low expressions are usually determined by study-specific cutoff values, which brings heterogeneity over multiple prognosis studies and difficulty to synthesizing the results in a simple way. In meta-analysis of diagnostic studies with binary outcomes, the summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) analysis provides a useful cutoff-free summary over studies. Recently, this methodology has been extended to the time-dependent SROC analysis for time-to-event outcomes in meta-analysis of prognosis studies. In this paper, we propose a sensitivity analysis method for evaluating the impact of publication bias on the time-dependent SROC analysis. Our proposal extends the recently introduced sensitivity analysis method for meta-analysis of diagnostic studies based on the bivariate normal model on sensitivity and specificity pairs. To model the selective publication process specific to prognosis studies, we introduce a trivariate model on the time-dependent sensitivity and specificity and the log-transformed HR. Based on the proved asymptotic property of the trivariate model, we introduce a likelihood based sensitivity analysis method based on the conditional likelihood constrained by the expected proportion of published studies. We illustrate the proposed sensitivity analysis method through the meta-analysis of Ki67 for breast cancer. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.",

Apart from volume fraction of nanoparticles, recent experiments have suggested that nanoscale phenomena such as nanoconfinement of grafted chains, altered dynamics and relaxation behavior at the segmental and colloidal scales, and cohesive energy between neighboring coronas are important factors that influence mechanical and rheological properties. How these factors influence the mechanics of thin films subject to micro-ballistic impact remains to be fully understood. Here we examine the micro-ballistic impact resistance of PGN thin films with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grafts using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The grafted chain length and nanoparticle core densities are systematically varied to understand the influences of interparticle spacing, cohesion, and momentum transfer effects under high-velocity impact. Our findings show that the inter-PGN cohesive energy density (",

        "content": "Studies in the existing literature propose that allocryptopine possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showcasing its neuroprotective effects by potentially mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aims to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of allocryptopine on various targets and potential mechanisms that have not been previously explored in the literature. Initially, we used MTT and LDH methods to evaluate the effects of allocryptopine on cell viability in BV-2 cells exposed to LPS-induced damage. Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), other inflammatory mediators (Cox-2 and iNOS), and p38 MAPK genes and proteins through qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Also, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on NF-κB proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p-p50, and p-p65) through ELISA assay. Molecular docking analyses were performed to investigate the potential binding of allocryptopine to target proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p50, p65, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, p38, AP-1 (c-Jun and ATF2), IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Cox-2, and iNOS) associated with the TLR4, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK pathways. Our results indicate that allocryptopine exerts a comprehensive influence on pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and modulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. The outcomes of our study suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy of allocryptopine is intricately linked to the modulation of key molecular pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of allocryptopine as a therapeutic agent for addressing neurodegenerative diseases by safeguarding neuronal health.",

        "content": "Global sensitivity analysis is the main quantitative technique for identifying the most influential input variables in a numerical simulation model. In particular when the inputs are independent, Sobol' sensitivity indices attribute a portion of the output of interest variance to each input and all possible interactions in the model, thanks to a functional ANOVA decomposition. On the other hand, moment-independent sensitivity indices focus on the impact of input variables on the whole output distribution instead of the variance only, thus providing complementary insight on the inputs / output relationship. Unfortunately they do not enjoy the nice decomposition property of Sobol' indices and are consequently harder to analyze. In this paper, we introduce two moment-independent indices based on kernel-embeddings of probability distributions and show that the RKHS framework used for their definition makes it possible to exhibit a kernel-based ANOVA decomposition. This is the first time such a desirable property is proved for sensitivity indices apart from Sobol' ones. When the inputs are dependent, we also use these new sensitivity indices as building blocks to design kernel-embedding Shapley effects which generalize the traditional variance-based ones used in sensitivity analysis. Several estimation procedures are discussed and illustrated on test cases with various output types such as categorical variables and probability distributions. All these examples show their potential for enhancing traditional sensitivity analysis with a kernel point of view.",

        "content": "In 1953, Grothendieck introduced and studied the Dunford--Pettis property (the $DP$ property) and the strict Dunford--Pettis property (the strict $DP$ property). The $DP$ property of order $p\\in[1,\\infty]$ for Banach spaces was introduced by Castillo and Sanchez in 1993. Being motivated by these notions, for $p,q\\in[1,\\infty]$, we define the strict Dunford--Pettis property of order $p$ (the strict $DP_p$ property) and the sequential Dunford--Pettis property of order $(p,q)$ (the sequential $DP_{(p,q)}$ property). We show that a locally convex space (lcs) $E$ has the $DP$ property iff the space $E$ endowed with the Grothendieck topology $\\tau_{\\Sigma'}$ has the weak Glicksberg property, and $E$ has the strict $DP_p$ property iff the space $(E,\\tau_{\\Sigma'}) $ has the $p$-Schur property. We also characterize lcs with the sequential $DP_{(p,q)}$ property. Some permanent properties and relationships between Dunford--Pettis type properties are studied. Numerous (counter)examples are given. In particular, we give the first example of an lcs with the strict $DP$ property but without the $DP$ property and show that the completion of even normed spaces with the $DP$ property may not have the $DP$ property.",

        "content": "In recent years, biomass carbon materials have received widespread attention in the field of electrochemical sensors. As a new type of renewable green energy, biomass carbon has the advantages of low cost and abundant resources. After special treatment, it can be used as an ideal electrode material. Since biomass carbon materials have diverse sources and their morphology is difficult to control, researchers have conducted in-depth research on their preparation process, morphology regulation and application. This review summarizes different biomass carbon structures and their preparation methods and explores the applications of these materials in electrochemical sensors. Modification of biomass carbon materials through pretreatment, physical and chemical activation, heteroatom doping, metal compound composite and other methods can make up for the deficiencies in its pore structure, electrical conductivity and surface wettability, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. The effects of different biomass sources, functional groups, constituent elements and modification methods on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are discussed, and the applications of this type of material in biological molecules, heavy metal ions and pesticide residues are reviewed. Biomass carbon-based materials show great application potential and development prospects in the field of electrochemical sensors.",

        "content": "Significant advancements in hydrogel-based epidermal electrodes have been made in recent years. However, inherent limitations, such as adaptability, adhesion, and conductivity, have presented challenges, thereby limiting the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stability of the physiological-electrode interface. In this study, we propose the concept of myelin sheath-inspired hydrogel epidermal electronics by incorporating numerous interpenetrating core-sheath-structured conductive nanofibers within a physically cross-linked polyelectrolyte network. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated sulfonated cellulose nanofibers (PEDOT:SCNFs) are synthesized through a simple solvent-catalyzed sulfonation process, followed by oxidative self-polymerization and ionic liquid (IL) shielding steps, achieving a low electrochemical impedance of 42 Ω. The physical associations within the composite hydrogel network include complexation, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction, and weak entanglements. These properties confer the hydrogel with high stretchability (770%), superconformability, self-adhesion (28 kPa on pigskin), and self-healing capabilities. By simulating the saltatory propagation effect of the nodes of Ranvier in the nervous system, the biomimetic hydrogel establishes high-fidelity epidermal electronic interfaces, offering benefits such as low interfacial contact impedance, significantly increased SNR (30 dB), as well as large-scale sensor array integration. The advanced biomimetic hydrogel holds tremendous potential for applications in electronic skin (e-skin), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and healthcare assessment devices.",

        "title": "Deterministic fabrication of graphene hexagonal boron nitride moiré superlattices.",
        "content": "The electronic properties of moiré heterostructures depend sensitively on the relative orientation between layers of the stack. For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a [Formula: see text] ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near-[Formula: see text], not [Formula: see text], relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy of the graphene/hBN moiré on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, nonaligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moiré heterostructures.",

        "content": "Cow milk (CM) is an important food source for humans, and food allergy caused by CM has attracted attention worldwide. To our knowledge, systematic studies about the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of CM are very rare. In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, and P. pentosaceus fermentation on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability was determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the protein quality, amino acid profile, and color were systematically evaluated. The results showed that these LAB strains exhibited higher protein degradation ability, and the IgE reactivity reduction rate was 41.03%-60.00% and the IgG reduction rate was 29.86%-67.20%, respectively. Additionally, the nutritional value was improved obviously, and the color was altered significantly, which was conductive to develop dairy products. These findings provided a theoretical foundation for the development of hypoallergenic dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus could be considered as good potential candidates for solving cow milk allergy owing to their decreased IgE/IgG binding ability andimproved nutritional and sensory properties, which provide a promising strategy to develop hypoallergenic dairy products.",

        "content": "The thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction represents one of the straightforward approaches to build thietane cores. Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report here a visible-light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls, though a Norrish type II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction with various non-volatile electron-rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocabonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides, as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1-acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer-based mechanism is proposed.",

        "publishedDate": "2021-08-20T13:46:49",
        "content": "Accurate and efficient valuation of property is of utmost importance in a variety of settings, such as when securing mortgage finance to purchase a property, or where residential property taxes are set as a percentage of a property's resale value. Internationally, resale based property taxes are most common due to ease of implementation and the difficulty of establishing site values. In an Irish context, property valuations are currently based on comparison to recently sold neighbouring properties, however, this approach is limited by low property turnover. National property taxes based on property value, as opposed to site value, also act as a disincentive to improvement works due to the ensuing increased tax burden. In this article we develop a spatial hedonic regression model to separate the spatial and non-spatial contributions of property features to resale value. We mitigate the issue of low property turnover through geographic correlation, borrowing information across multiple property types and finishes. We investigate the impact of address mislabelling on predictive performance, where vendors erroneously supply a more affluent postcode, and evaluate the contribution of improvement works to increased values. Our flexible geo-spatial model outperforms all competitors across a number of different evaluation metrics, including the accuracy of both price prediction and associated uncertainty intervals. While our models are applied in an Irish context, the ability to accurately value properties in markets with low property turnover and to quantify the value contributions of specific property features has widespread application. The ability to separate spatial and non-spatial contributions to a property's value also provides an avenue to site-value based property taxes.",

Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices. Altogether, we show in this review the potential of RuII acetylide compounds, insisting on the molecular design and suggesting further research developments for this class of organometallic dyes, including supramolecular chemistry.",

        "content": "Self-assembled polymer grafted nanoparticles (PGNs) are of great interest for their potential to enhance mechanical properties compared to neat polymers and nanocomposites. Apart from volume fraction of nanoparticles, recent experiments have suggested that nanoscale phenomena such as nanoconfinement of grafted chains, altered dynamics and relaxation behavior at the segmental and colloidal scales, and cohesive energy between neighboring coronas are important factors that influence mechanical and rheological properties. How these factors influence the mechanics of thin films subject to micro-ballistic impact remains to be fully understood. Here we examine the micro-ballistic impact resistance of PGN thin films with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grafts using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The grafted chain length and nanoparticle core densities are systematically varied to understand the influences of interparticle spacing, cohesion, and momentum transfer effects under high-velocity impact. Our findings show that the inter-PGN cohesive energy density (",

        "content": "Studies in the existing literature propose that allocryptopine possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showcasing its neuroprotective effects by potentially mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aims to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of allocryptopine on various targets and potential mechanisms that have not been previously explored in the literature. Initially, we used MTT and LDH methods to evaluate the effects of allocryptopine on cell viability in BV-2 cells exposed to LPS-induced damage. Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), other inflammatory mediators (Cox-2 and iNOS), and p38 MAPK genes and proteins through qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Also, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on NF-κB proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p-p50, and p-p65) through ELISA assay. Molecular docking analyses were performed to investigate the potential binding of allocryptopine to target proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p50, p65, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, p38, AP-1 (c-Jun and ATF2), IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Cox-2, and iNOS) associated with the TLR4, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK pathways. Our results indicate that allocryptopine exerts a comprehensive influence on pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and modulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. The outcomes of our study suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy of allocryptopine is intricately linked to the modulation of key molecular pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of allocryptopine as a therapeutic agent for addressing neurodegenerative diseases by safeguarding neuronal health.",

        "content": "Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a Class C infectious disease that carries particularly high risk for preschool children and is a leading cause of childhood death in some countries. We mimic the periodic outbreak of HFMD over a 2-year period-with differing amplitudes-and propose a dynamic HFMD model that differentiates transmission between mature and immature individuals and uses two possible optimal-control strategies to minimize case numbers, total costs and deaths. We parameterized the model by fitting it to HFMD data in mainland China from January 2011 to December 2018, and the basic reproduction number was estimated as 0.9599. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that transmission between immature and mature individuals contributes substantially to new infections. Increasing the isolation rates of infectious individuals-particularly mature infectious individuals-could greatly reduce the outbreak risk and potentially eradicate the disease in a relatively short time period. It follows that we have a reasonable chance of controlling HFMD if we can reduce transmission in children under 7 and isolate older infectious individuals.",

        "content": "This paper proposes a framework to analyze the effects of counterfactual policies on the unconditional quantiles of an outcome variable. For a given counterfactual policy, we obtain identified sets for the effect of both marginal and global changes in the proportion of treated individuals. To conduct a sensitivity analysis, we introduce the quantile breakdown frontier, a curve that (i) indicates whether a sensitivity analysis is possible or not, and (ii) when a sensitivity analysis is possible, quantifies the amount of selection bias consistent with a given conclusion of interest across different quantiles. To illustrate our method, we perform a sensitivity analysis on the effect of unionizing low income workers on the quantiles of the distribution of (log) wages.",

        "content": "Fear avoidance behaviour is associated with slow recovery from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). This study is a preliminary evaluation of graded exposure therapy (GET), which directly targets fear avoidance behaviour, for reducing post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and disability following mTBI. In a historical comparison design, we compared two groups from independent randomized trials. The GET + UC group (N = 34) received GET (delivered over 16 videoconference sessions) in addition to usual care (UC). The historical comparison group (N = 71) received UC only. PCS severity (Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire; RPQ) and disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule; WHODAS 2.0 12-item) were measured at clinic intake (M = 2.7, SD = 1.1 months after injury) and again at M = 4.9 (SD = 1.1) months after injury. Between-group differences were estimated using linear mixed effects regression, with a sensitivity analysis controlling for injury-to-assessment intervals. The estimated average change on the RPQ was -14.3 in the GET + UC group and -5.3 in the UC group. The estimated average change on the WHODAS was -5.3 in the GET + UC group and -3.2 in the UC group. Between-group differences post-treatment were -5.3 on the RPQ and -1.5 on the WHODAS. Treatment effects were larger in sensitivity analyses. Findings suggest that a randomized controlled trial is warranted.",

TFHA provides sensitivities of quantities of interest from time-periodic problems w.r.t. many design parameters, as used in the design process of power-electronics devices. The TFHA shows advantages in applications where the harmonic balance based adjoint sensitivity analysis or finite difference approaches for sensitivity analysis perform poorly. In contrast to existing methods, the TFHA can be used in combination with arbitrary forward solvers, i.e. general transient solvers.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-09-12T16:36:22",
        "content": "In matched observational studies, the inferred causal conclusions pretending that matching has taken into account all confounding can be sensitive to unmeasured confounding. In such cases, a sensitivity analysis is often conducted, which investigates whether the observed association between treatment and outcome is due to effects caused by the treatment or it is due to hidden confounding. In general, a sensitivity analysis tries to infer the minimum amount of hidden biases needed in order to explain away the observed association between treatment and outcome, assuming that the treatment has no effect. If the needed bias is large, then the treatment is likely to have significant effects. The Rosenbaum sensitivity analysis is a modern approach for conducting sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies. It investigates what magnitude the maximum of the hidden biases from all matched sets needs to be in order to explain away the observed association, assuming that the treatment has no effect. However, such a sensitivity analysis can be overly conservative and pessimistic, especially when the investigators believe that some matched sets may have exceptionally large hidden biases. In this paper, we generalize Rosenbaum's framework to conduct sensitivity analysis on quantiles of hidden biases from all matched sets, which are more robust than the maximum. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis on all quantiles of hidden biases is simultaneously valid and is thus a free lunch added to the conventional sensitivity analysis. The proposed approach works for general outcomes, general matched studies and general test statistics. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis also works for bounded null hypotheses as long as the test statistic satisfies certain properties. An R package implementing the proposed method is also available online.",

        "content": "A highly versatile evaluation method is proposed for transient plasmas based on statistical physics. It would be beneficial in various industrial sectors, including semiconductors and automobiles. Our research focused on low-energy plasmas in laboratory settings, and they were assessed via our proposed method, which incorporates relative entropy and fractional Brownian motion, based on a revised collisional-radiative model. By introducing an indicator to evaluate how far a system is from its steady state, both the trend of entropy and the radiative process' contribution to the lifetime of excited states were considered. The high statistical weight of some excited states may act as a bottleneck in the plasma's energy relaxation throughout the system to a steady state. By deepening our understanding of how energy flows through plasmas, we anticipate potential contributions to resolving global environmental issues and fostering technological innovation in plasma-related industrial fields.",

We study the special case of absence of symmetry induced by a group of scaling transformations of the continuous distribution of frequencies. When coupling between oscillators is increased beyond a critical threshold favoring spontaneous synchronization, we found that the variation in the velocity of the traveling wave depends on the extent of asymmetry in the natural frequency distribution. In particular for large coupling this velocity is the average natural frequency whereas at the onset of synchronization it corresponds to the frequency where the Hilbert Transform of the frequency distribution vanishes.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-01-12T21:49:25",
        "content": "Matching is one of the most widely used study designs for adjusting for measured confounders in observational studies. However, unmeasured confounding may exist and cannot be removed by matching. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis is typically needed to assess a causal conclusion's sensitivity to unmeasured confounding. Sensitivity analysis frameworks for binary exposures have been well-established for various matching designs and are commonly used in various studies. However, unlike the binary exposure case, there still lacks valid and general sensitivity analysis methods for continuous exposures, except in some special cases such as pair matching. To fill this gap in the binary outcome case, we develop a sensitivity analysis framework for general matching designs with continuous exposures and binary outcomes. First, we use probabilistic lattice theory to show our sensitivity analysis approach is finite-population-exact under Fisher's sharp null. Second, we prove a novel design sensitivity formula as a powerful tool for asymptotically evaluating the performance of our sensitivity analysis approach. Third, to allow effect heterogeneity with binary outcomes, we introduce a framework for conducting asymptotically exact inference and sensitivity analysis on generalized attributable effects with binary outcomes via mixed-integer programming. Fourth, for the continuous outcomes case, we show that conducting an asymptotically exact sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies when both the exposures and outcomes are continuous is generally NP-hard, except in some special cases such as pair matching. As a real data application, we apply our new methods to study the effect of early-life lead exposure on juvenile delinquency. We also develop a publicly available R package for implementation of the methods in this work.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-03-21T05:57:43",
        "content": "In matched observational studies with binary treatments, the Rosenbaum bounds framework is arguably the most widely used sensitivity analysis framework for assessing sensitivity to unobserved covariates. Unlike the binary treatment case, although widely needed in practice, sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies with treatment doses (i.e., non-binary treatments such as ordinal treatments or continuous treatments) still lacks solid foundations and valid methodologies. We fill in this blank by establishing theoretical foundations and novel methodologies under a generalized Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis framework. First, we present a criterion for assessing the validity of sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies with treatment doses and use that criterion to justify the necessity of incorporating the treatment dose information into sensitivity analysis through generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds. We also generalize Rosenbaum's classic sensitivity parameter $\\Gamma$ to the non-binary treatment case and prove its sufficiency. Second, we study the asymptotic properties of sensitivity analysis by generalizing Rosenbaum's classic design sensitivity and Bahadur efficiency for testing Fisher's sharp null to the non-binary treatment case and deriving novel formulas for them. Our theoretical results showed the importance of appropriately incorporating the treatment dose into a test, which is an intrinsic distinction with the binary treatment case. Third, for testing Neyman's weak null (i.e., null sample average treatment effect), we propose the first valid sensitivity analysis procedure for matching with treatment dose through generalizing an existing optimization-based sensitivity analysis for the binary treatment case, built on the generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds and large-scale mixed integer programming.",

        "content": "The collective behavior in a population of globally coupled oscillators with randomly distributed frequencies is studied when the natural frequency distribution does not possess an even symmetry with respect to the average natural frequency of oscillators. We study the special case of absence of symmetry induced by a group of scaling transformations of the continuous distribution of frequencies. When coupling between oscillators is increased beyond a critical threshold favoring spontaneous synchronization, we found that the variation in the velocity of the traveling wave depends on the extent of asymmetry in the natural frequency distribution. In particular for large coupling this velocity is the average natural frequency whereas at the onset of synchronization it corresponds to the frequency where the Hilbert Transform of the frequency distribution vanishes.",

        "content": "Previous studies on the modification of fast-growing wood have extensively examined the effects of density and lignin content on the strength and high-temperature properties of modified wood. However, a comprehensive quantitative analysis of their effects on high-temperature performance remains insufficient. To address this knowledge gap, we applied alkali treatment and compression densification to fast-growing poplar, resulting in modified specimens with varying densities and lignin levels. The quantitative effects of density and lignin content on high-temperature properties were meticulously evaluated. Chemical changes were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), while the mechanical and high-temperature properties were comprehensively assessed. Delignification was found to be positively correlated with treatment duration, with hemicellulose degradation also detected via FT-IR analysis. Significant enhancements were recorded in flexural strength, tensile strength, and modulus of elasticity, accompanied by improvements in ductility ratio and compressive strength. The modified poplar wood exhibited increased thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, density and lignin content were identified as significant factors affecting high-temperature performance, establishing minimum density thresholds for various lignin contents in modified poplar wood to ensure optimal performance. This study enhances to the understanding of the intricate relationships among wood properties, modification techniques, and high-temperature performance.",

The results illustrates that the incident wave can enhance the resonance response at the redistributed resonance frequency, which leads to an increase in radial acceleration and the secondary Bjerknes force, and rapid approach of bubbles. Furthermore, the influence of incident wave on the interaction of bubbles driven at lower frequencies is more significant, due to resonance enhancement caused by the proximity of natural frequencies and frequency multiplications of the external sound field. Our findings reveal that the compressible effect is not only critical to interaction in radial oscillations, but also in translational motion.",

        "content": "Synchronization among rhythmic elements is modeled by coupled phase-oscillators each of which has the so-called natural frequency. A symmetric natural frequency distribution induces a continuous or discontinuous synchronization transition from the nonsynchronized state, for instance. It has been numerically reported that asymmetry in the natural frequency distribution brings new types of bifurcation diagram having, in the order parameter, oscillation or a discontinuous jump which emerges from a partially synchronized state. We propose a theoretical classification method of five types of bifurcation diagrams including the new ones, paying attention to the generality of the theory. The oscillation and the jump from partially synchronized states are discussed respectively by the linear analysis around the nonsynchronized state and by extending the amplitude equation up to the third leading term. The theoretical classification is examined by comparing with numerically obtained one.",

        "content": "Renewable feedstocks are sought for clean technology applications, including energy storage applications. In this study, LignoForce™ lignin, a biobased aromatic polymer commercially isolated from wood, was fractioned into two parts using acetone, and the resulting lignin fractions had distinct thermo-rheological behavior. These two fractionated lignins were combined in various ratios and transformed into nanofibers by electrospinning. Subsequently, electrospun fiber materials were disrupted by agitating the mats in water, and the materials were transformed into ultralight 3D aerogels through lyophilization and post-process controlled heating. Using only this combination of two fractions, the morphology of lignin nanofibers was tailored by heat treatment, resulting in lignin aerogels with high flexibility and significant shape recovery properties. Various microscale structures of lignin fibers impacted the resulting physical properties of the elastic aerogel materials, such as resilience, compressive strength, and electrical conductivity for the corresponding carbonized samples. By exploiting lignin's sensitivity to heat and tailoring the thermal properties of the lignin through fractionation, the work provided an interesting path to form robust lignin-derived functional materials without any toxic chemical additives and significant ability to serve as free-standing electrodes with specific capacitance values better than some graphene-based supercapacitors.",

It is well known that for a spring-mass system wherein the adjacent masses are linked through a spring, the natural frequency assignment can be achieved by choosing appropriate masses and spring stiffnesses if and only if the given positive eigenvalues are distinct. However, when we involve inerters, multiple eigenvalues in the assignment are allowed. In fact, arbitrarily given a set of positive real numbers, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition on the multiplicities of these numbers, which are assigned as the natural frequencies of the concerned mass-spring-inerter system.",

A novel approach is presented, in which vibrations of the muscle of interest are measured in a contactless manner using laser displacement sensor and the measured vibration signals are analyzed by an advanced technique of experimental modal analysis to extract fundamental natural frequency of the muscle with high accuracy.

However, empirical studies have suggested that the NF facilitation effect might be limited to specific groups of individuals.

        "publishedDate": "2021-06-11T15:59:33",
        "content": "For natural frequency optimization of engineering structures, cellular composites have been shown to possess an edge over solid. However, existing multiscale design methods for cellular composites are either computationally exhaustive or confined to a single class of microstructures. In this paper, we propose a data-driven topology optimization (TO) approach to enable the multiscale design of cellular structures with various choices of microstructure classes. The key component is a newly proposed latent-variable Gaussian process (LVGP) model through which different classes of microstructures are mapped into a low-dimensional continuous latent space. It provides an interpretable distance metric between classes and captures their effects on the homogenized stiffness tensors. By introducing latent vectors as design variables, a differentiable transition of stiffness matrix between classes can be easily achieved with an analytical gradient. After integrating LVGP with the density-based TO, an efficient data-driven cellular composite optimization process is developed to enable concurrent exploration of microstructure concepts and the associated volume fractions for natural frequency optimization. Examples reveal that the proposed cellular designs with multiclass microstructures achieve higher natural frequencies than both single-scale and single-class designs. This framework can be easily extended to other multi-scale TO problems, such as thermal compliance and dynamic response optimization.",

        "content": "The pulp and paper industry generates vast quantities of paper sludge, posing significant environmental challenges due to its disposal in landfills or incineration. This study explores the potential of valorizing paper sludge by incorporating it into particleboard production. It aims to optimize sludge content and particle size to enhance board properties-a novel approach to waste management in the wood composites industry. Through systematic variation of sludge content (0-25%) and particle size (< 0.5 to > 2 mm), we assessed the mechanical and physical properties such as internal bond strength (IB), modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), water absorption (WA), and thickness swelling (TS). The findings indicate that incorporating paper sludge at moderate levels (5-15%) with optimized particle sizes (< 1 mm) significantly improves the mechanical properties of the particleboard, including increased IB, MOR, and MOE while reducing WA and TS. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) further supported these results, revealing that higher-density boards with enhanced mechanical properties absorb less water, highlighting the interrelationship between structural integrity and moisture resistance. The PCA also identified thickness swelling as an independent factor, suggesting that while mechanical properties can be optimized, additional strategies are needed to control swelling. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that up to 15% paper sludge can be effectively used in particleboard production without compromising quality, provided particle size is carefully controlled. This approach not only offers a sustainable solution for managing paper sludge but also contributes to the development of eco-friendly composite materials, aligning with circular economy principles.",

        "content": "The paper studies the topological changes from before and after cointegration, for the natural frequencies of the Z24 Bridge. The second natural frequency is known to be nonlinear in temperature, and this will serve as the main focal point of this work. Cointegration is a method of normalising time series data with respect to one another - often strongly-correlated time series. Cointegration is used in this paper to remove effects from Environmental and Operational Variations, by cointegrating the first four natural frequencies for the Z24 Bridge data. The temperature effects on the natural frequency data are clearly visible within the data, and it is desirable, for the purposes of structural health monitoring, that these effects are removed. The univariate time series are embedded in higher-dimensional space, such that interesting topologies are formed. Topological data analysis is used to analyse the raw time series, and the cointegrated equivalents. A standard topological data analysis pipeline is enacted, where simplicial complexes are constructed from the embedded point clouds. Topological properties are then calculated from the simplicial complexes; such as the persistent homology. The persistent homology is then analysed, to determine the topological structure of all the time series.",

        "content": "The multidimensional Kuramoto model describes the synchronization dynamics of particles moving on the surface of D-dimensional spheres, generalizing the original model where particles were characterized by a single phase. In this setup, particles are more easily represented by $D$-dimensional unit vectors than by $D-1$ spherical angles, allowing for the coupling constant to be extended to a coupling matrix acting on the vectors. As in the original Kuramoto model, each particle has a set of $D(D-1)/2$ natural frequencies, drawn from a distribution. The system has a large number of independent parameters, given by the average natural frequencies, the characteristic widths of their distributions plus $D^2$ constants of the coupling matrix. General phase diagrams, indicating regions in parameter space where the system exhibits different behaviors, are hard to derive analytically. Here we obtain the complete phase diagram for $D=2$ and Lorentzian distributions of natural frequencies using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz. We also explore the diagrams numerically for different distributions and some specific choices of parameters for $D=2$, $D=3$ and $D=4$. In all cases the system exhibits at most four different phases: disordered, static synchrony, rotation and active synchrony. Existence of specific phases and boundaries between them depend strongly on the dimension $D$, the coupling matrix and the distribution of natural frequencies.",

        "content": "As a mature non-destructive testing technology, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy can effectively identify and distinguish the structural characteristics of wood. The Wood Defect One-Dimensional Visual Geometry Group 19-Finite Element Analysis (WD-1D-VGG19-FEA) algorithm is used in this study. 1D-VGG19 classifies the near-infrared spectroscopy data to determine the knot area, fiber deviation area, transition area, and net wood area of the solid wood board surface and generates a two-dimensional image of the board surface through inversion. Then, the nonlinear three-dimensional model of wood with defects was established by using the inverse image, and the finite element analysis was carried out to predict the elastic modulus of wood. In the experiment, 270 points were selected from each of the four regions of the wood, totaling 1080 sets of near-infrared data, and the 1D-VGG19 model was used for classification. The results showed that the identification accuracy of the knot area was 95.1%, the fiber deviation area was 92.7%, the transition area was 90.2%, the net wood area was 100%, and the average accuracy was 94.5%. The error range of the elastic modulus prediction of the three-dimensional model established by the VGG19 classification model in the finite element analysis is between 2% and 10%, the root mean square error (RMSE) is about 598. 2, and the coefficient of determination (R2) is 0. 91. This study shows that the combination of the VGG19 algorithm and finite element analysis can accurately describe the nonlinear defect morphology of wood, thus establishing a more accurate prediction model of wood mechanical properties to maximize the use of wood mechanical properties.",

Among other choices we select the grid size and topology in a way that we observe a dynamically induced dimensional reduction with a continuum of attractors as long as the natural frequencies are uniformly chosen. When we introduce disorder in these frequencies, we find limit cycles with periods that are orders of magnitude longer than the natural frequencies of individual oscillators. Moreover we identify sequences of temporary patterns of phase-locked motion, which are self-similar in time and whose periods scale with a power of the inverse width about a uniform frequency distribution.

        "content": "In recent years, biomass carbon materials have received widespread attention in the field of electrochemical sensors. As a new type of renewable green energy, biomass carbon has the advantages of low cost and abundant resources. After special treatment, it can be used as an ideal electrode material. Since biomass carbon materials have diverse sources and their morphology is difficult to control, researchers have conducted in-depth research on their preparation process, morphology regulation and application. This review summarizes different biomass carbon structures and their preparation methods and explores the applications of these materials in electrochemical sensors. Modification of biomass carbon materials through pretreatment, physical and chemical activation, heteroatom doping, metal compound composite and other methods can make up for the deficiencies in its pore structure, electrical conductivity and surface wettability, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. The effects of different biomass sources, functional groups, constituent elements and modification methods on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are discussed, and the applications of this type of material in biological molecules, heavy metal ions and pesticide residues are reviewed. Biomass carbon-based materials show great application potential and development prospects in the field of electrochemical sensors.",

Modal parameters of the ambient vibration structures consist of natural frequencies, mode shapes, and modal damping ratios. In this paper, a typical frame with arbitrary loading has been modeled in finite element software, ANSYS, and the responses (accelerations of nodes) have been achieved. By using these data and the codes written in MATLAB, the modal parameters (natural frequencies, mode shapes) of the beams are identified with FDD (Frequency Domain Decomposition) and PP (Peak Picking) methods and then justified with the results of input-output method which was determined by modal analysis. The results indicate that there is a good agreement between three methods for determining the dynamic characteristics of frames. Then, the minimum number of required accelerometer has been determined that recording the acceleration in that location leads to identifying all the natural frequencies of the frame.",

        "content": "Significant advancements in hydrogel-based epidermal electrodes have been made in recent years. However, inherent limitations, such as adaptability, adhesion, and conductivity, have presented challenges, thereby limiting the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stability of the physiological-electrode interface. In this study, we propose the concept of myelin sheath-inspired hydrogel epidermal electronics by incorporating numerous interpenetrating core-sheath-structured conductive nanofibers within a physically cross-linked polyelectrolyte network. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated sulfonated cellulose nanofibers (PEDOT:SCNFs) are synthesized through a simple solvent-catalyzed sulfonation process, followed by oxidative self-polymerization and ionic liquid (IL) shielding steps, achieving a low electrochemical impedance of 42 Ω. The physical associations within the composite hydrogel network include complexation, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction, and weak entanglements. These properties confer the hydrogel with high stretchability (770%), superconformability, self-adhesion (28 kPa on pigskin), and self-healing capabilities. By simulating the saltatory propagation effect of the nodes of Ranvier in the nervous system, the biomimetic hydrogel establishes high-fidelity epidermal electronic interfaces, offering benefits such as low interfacial contact impedance, significantly increased SNR (30 dB), as well as large-scale sensor array integration. The advanced biomimetic hydrogel holds tremendous potential for applications in electronic skin (e-skin), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and healthcare assessment devices.",

        "content": "The paper studies the topological changes from before and after cointegration, for the natural frequencies of the Z24 Bridge. The second natural frequency is known to be nonlinear in temperature, and this will serve as the main focal point of this work. Cointegration is a method of normalising time series data with respect to one another - often strongly-correlated time series. Cointegration is used in this paper to remove effects from Environmental and Operational Variations, by cointegrating the first four natural frequencies for the Z24 Bridge data. The temperature effects on the natural frequency data are clearly visible within the data, and it is desirable, for the purposes of structural health monitoring, that these effects are removed. The univariate time series are embedded in higher-dimensional space, such that interesting topologies are formed. Topological data analysis is used to analyse the raw time series, and the cointegrated equivalents. A standard topological data analysis pipeline is enacted, where simplicial complexes are constructed from the embedded point clouds. Topological properties are then calculated from the simplicial complexes; such as the persistent homology. The persistent homology is then analysed, to determine the topological structure of all the time series.",

        "content": "The electronic properties of moiré heterostructures depend sensitively on the relative orientation between layers of the stack. For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a [Formula: see text] ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near-[Formula: see text], not [Formula: see text], relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy of the graphene/hBN moiré on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, nonaligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moiré heterostructures.",

        "content": "Globally coupled ensembles of phase oscillators serve as useful tools for modeling synchronization and collective behavior in a variety of applications. As interest in the effects of simplicial interactions (i.e., non-additive, higher-order interactions between three or more units) continues to grow we study an extension of the Kuramoto model where oscillators are coupled via three-way interactions that exhibits novel dynamical properties including clustering, multistability, and abrupt desynchronization transitions. Here we provide a rigorous description of the stability of various multicluster states by studying their spectral properties in the thermodynamic limit. Not unlike the classical Kuramoto model, a natural frequency distribution with infinite support yields a population of drifting oscillators, which in turn guarantees that a portion of the spectrum is located on the imaginary axes, resulting in neutrally stable or unstable solutions. On the other hand, a natural frequency distribution with finite support allows for a fully phase-locked state, whose spectrum is real and may be linearly stable or unstable.",

        "content": "Cow milk (CM) is an important food source for humans, and food allergy caused by CM has attracted attention worldwide. To our knowledge, systematic studies about the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of CM are very rare. In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, and P. pentosaceus fermentation on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability was determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the protein quality, amino acid profile, and color were systematically evaluated. The results showed that these LAB strains exhibited higher protein degradation ability, and the IgE reactivity reduction rate was 41.03%-60.00% and the IgG reduction rate was 29.86%-67.20%, respectively. Additionally, the nutritional value was improved obviously, and the color was altered significantly, which was conductive to develop dairy products. These findings provided a theoretical foundation for the development of hypoallergenic dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus could be considered as good potential candidates for solving cow milk allergy owing to their decreased IgE/IgG binding ability andimproved nutritional and sensory properties, which provide a promising strategy to develop hypoallergenic dairy products.",

        "content": "Synchronization of network-coupled dynamical units is important to a variety of natural and engineered processes including circadian rhythms, cardiac function, neural processing, and power grids. Despite this ubiquity, it remains poorly understood how complex network structures and heterogeneous local dynamics combine to either promote or inhibit synchronization. Moreover, for most real-world applications it is impossible to obtain the exact specifications of the system, and there is a lack of theory for how uncertainty affects synchronization. We address this open problem by studying the Synchrony Alignment Function (SAF), which is an objective measure for the synchronization properties of a network of heterogeneous oscillators with given natural frequencies. We extend the SAF framework to analyze network-coupled oscillators with heterogeneous natural frequencies that are drawn as a multivariate random vector. Using probability theory for quadratic forms, we obtain expressions for the expectation and variance of the SAF for given network structures. We conclude with numerical experiments that illustrate how the incorporation of uncertainty yields a more robust theoretical framework for enhancing synchronization, and we provide new perspectives for why synchronization is generically promoted by network properties including degree-frequency correlations, link directedness, and link weight delocalization.",

Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report here a visible-light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls, though a Norrish type II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction with various non-volatile electron-rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocabonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides, as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1-acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer-based mechanism is proposed.",

        "content": "Efficient and accurate numerical algorithms are developed to solve a generalized Kirchhoff-Love plate model subject to three common physical boundary conditions: (i) clamped; (ii) simply supported; and (iii) free. We solve the model equation by discretizing the spatial derivatives using second-order finite-difference schemes, and then advancing the semi-discrete problem in time with either an explicit predictor-corrector or an implicit Newmark-Beta time-stepping algorithm. Stability analysis is conducted for the schemes and the results are used to determine stable time steps in practice. A series of carefully chosen test problems are solved to demonstrate the properties and applications of our numerical approaches. The numerical results confirm the stability and 2nd-order accuracy of the algorithms, and are also comparable with experiments for similar thin plates. As an application, we illustrate a strategy to identify the natural frequencies of a plate using our numerical methods in conjunction with a fast Fourier transformation (FFT) power spectrum analysis of the computed data. Then we take advantage of one of the computed natural frequencies to simulate the interesting physical phenomena known as resonance and beat for a generalized Kirchhoff-Love plate.",

Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices.

Apart from volume fraction of nanoparticles, recent experiments have suggested that nanoscale phenomena such as nanoconfinement of grafted chains, altered dynamics and relaxation behavior at the segmental and colloidal scales, and cohesive energy between neighboring coronas are important factors that influence mechanical and rheological properties. How these factors influence the mechanics of thin films subject to micro-ballistic impact remains to be fully understood. Here we examine the micro-ballistic impact resistance of PGN thin films with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grafts using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The grafted chain length and nanoparticle core densities are systematically varied to understand the influences of interparticle spacing, cohesion, and momentum transfer effects under high-velocity impact.

This allows us to derive approximated nonlinear kinematic models and a dynamical model, which is explored to understand the correlation between natural frequency and dimensional parameters of SPA. The design problem is then transformed into an optimization problem, using kinematic equations as the objective function and the dynamical equation as a constraint. By solving this optimization problem, the optimal dimensional parameters are determined. Six prototypes are manufactured to validate the proposed approach. The optimal actuator successfully generates the desired force/torque and bending angle, while its natural frequency remains within the constrained range. This work highlights the potential of using optimization formulation and approximated nonlinear models to boost the performance and dynamical properties of soft pneumatic actuators.",

        "content": "Studies in the existing literature propose that allocryptopine possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showcasing its neuroprotective effects by potentially mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aims to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of allocryptopine on various targets and potential mechanisms that have not been previously explored in the literature. Initially, we used MTT and LDH methods to evaluate the effects of allocryptopine on cell viability in BV-2 cells exposed to LPS-induced damage. Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), other inflammatory mediators (Cox-2 and iNOS), and p38 MAPK genes and proteins through qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Also, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on NF-κB proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p-p50, and p-p65) through ELISA assay. Molecular docking analyses were performed to investigate the potential binding of allocryptopine to target proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p50, p65, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, p38, AP-1 (c-Jun and ATF2), IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Cox-2, and iNOS) associated with the TLR4, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK pathways. Our results indicate that allocryptopine exerts a comprehensive influence on pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and modulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. The outcomes of our study suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy of allocryptopine is intricately linked to the modulation of key molecular pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of allocryptopine as a therapeutic agent for addressing neurodegenerative diseases by safeguarding neuronal health.",

        "title": "A new perspective on Bayesian Operational Modal Analysis",
        "publishedDate": "2024-08-16T11:11:56",
        "content": "In the field of operational modal analysis (OMA), obtained modal information is frequently used to assess the current state of aerospace, mechanical, offshore and civil structures. However, the stochasticity of operational systems and the lack of forcing information can lead to inconsistent results. Quantifying the uncertainty of the recovered modal parameters through OMA is therefore of significant value. In this article, a new perspective on Bayesian OMA is proposed: a Bayesian stochastic subspace identification (SSI) algorithm. Distinct from existing approaches to Bayesian OMA, a hierarchical probabilistic model is embedded at the core of covariance-driven SSI. Through substitution of canonical correlation analysis with a Bayesian equivalent, posterior distributions over the modal properties are obtained. Two inference schemes are presented for the proposed Bayesian formulation: Markov Chain Monte Carlo and variational Bayes. Two case studies are then explored. The first is benchmark study using data from a simulated, multi degree-of-freedom, linear system. Following application of Bayesian SSI, it is shown that the same posterior is targeted and recovered by both inference schemes, with good agreement between the posterior mean and the conventional SSI result. The second study applies the variational form to data obtained from an in-service structure: The Z24 bridge. The results of this study are presented at single model orders, and then using a stabilisation diagram. The recovered posterior uncertainty is presented and compared to the classic SSI result. It is observed that the posterior distributions with mean values coinciding with the natural frequencies exhibit lower variance than values situated away from the natural frequencies.",

        "content": "Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is one of the most widely explored additive manufacturing method that uses thermoplastic materials to manufacture products. Mechanical properties of parts manufactured using FDM are influenced by different process parameters involved during manufacturing as they impact the bonding among different layers of cross-section. In this study, the effect of infill patterns and build orientations on the mechanical properties of PLA based parts manufactured using FDM method is studied. Six different infill patterns (triangles, cubic, concentric, tetrahedral, lines, and zigzag) and three different orientations (flatwise, edgewise, and upright) are considered for rectangular beam type parts. For determining mechanical properties of parts with different infill patterns and orientations, flexural bending test is performed. Experimental modal analysis of manufactured parts is performed to observe the relation of natural frequencies with elastic modulus of the parts obtained from flexural bending test. The possibility of experimental modal analysis as an alternative non-destructive method for testing mechanical properties of FDM 3D printed parts is explored.",

Sensitivity analysis assesses how input changes affect the output, constituting a key component of interpretation. Among the post-hoc interpretation methods such as back-propagation, perturbation, and approximation, my work will investigate perturbation-based sensitivity Analysis methods on modern Transformer models to benchmark their performances. Specifically, my work answers three research questions: 1) Do different sensitivity analysis (SA) methods yield comparable outputs and attribute importance rankings? 2) Using the same sensitivity analysis method, do different Deep Learning (DL) models impact the output of the sensitivity analysis? 3) How well do the results from sensitivity analysis methods align with the ground truth?",

        "content": "Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a Class C infectious disease that carries particularly high risk for preschool children and is a leading cause of childhood death in some countries. We mimic the periodic outbreak of HFMD over a 2-year period-with differing amplitudes-and propose a dynamic HFMD model that differentiates transmission between mature and immature individuals and uses two possible optimal-control strategies to minimize case numbers, total costs and deaths. We parameterized the model by fitting it to HFMD data in mainland China from January 2011 to December 2018, and the basic reproduction number was estimated as 0.9599. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that transmission between immature and mature individuals contributes substantially to new infections. Increasing the isolation rates of infectious individuals-particularly mature infectious individuals-could greatly reduce the outbreak risk and potentially eradicate the disease in a relatively short time period. It follows that we have a reasonable chance of controlling HFMD if we can reduce transmission in children under 7 and isolate older infectious individuals.",

This study is a preliminary evaluation of graded exposure therapy (GET), which directly targets fear avoidance behaviour, for reducing post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and disability following mTBI. In a historical comparison design, we compared two groups from independent randomized trials. The GET + UC group (N = 34) received GET (delivered over 16 videoconference sessions) in addition to usual care (UC). The historical comparison group (N = 71) received UC only. PCS severity (Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire; RPQ) and disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule; WHODAS 2.0 12-item) were measured at clinic intake (M = 2.7, SD = 1.1 months after injury) and again at M = 4.9 (SD = 1.1) months after injury. Between-group differences were estimated using linear mixed effects regression, with a sensitivity analysis controlling for injury-to-assessment intervals. The estimated average change on the RPQ was -14.3 in the GET + UC group and -5.3 in the UC group. The estimated average change on the WHODAS was -5.3 in the GET + UC group and -3.2 in the UC group. Between-group differences post-treatment were -5.3 on the RPQ and -1.5 on the WHODAS. Treatment effects were larger in sensitivity analyses. Findings suggest that a randomized controlled trial is warranted.",

For a given counterfactual policy, we obtain identified sets for the effect of both marginal and global changes in the proportion of treated individuals. To conduct a sensitivity analysis, we introduce the quantile breakdown frontier, a curve that (i) indicates whether a sensitivity analysis is possible or not, and (ii) when a sensitivity analysis is possible, quantifies the amount of selection bias consistent with a given conclusion of interest across different quantiles. To illustrate our method, we perform a sensitivity analysis on the effect of unionizing low income workers on the quantiles of the distribution of (log) wages.",

TFHA provides sensitivities of quantities of interest from time-periodic problems w.r.t. many design parameters, as used in the design process of power-electronics devices. The TFHA shows advantages in applications where the harmonic balance based adjoint sensitivity analysis or finite difference approaches for sensitivity analysis perform poorly. In contrast to existing methods, the TFHA can be used in combination with arbitrary forward solvers, i.e. general transient solvers.",

Our research focused on low-energy plasmas in laboratory settings, and they were assessed via our proposed method, which incorporates relative entropy and fractional Brownian motion, based on a revised collisional-radiative model. By introducing an indicator to evaluate how far a system is from its steady state, both the trend of entropy and the radiative process' contribution to the lifetime of excited states were considered. The high statistical weight of some excited states may act as a bottleneck in the plasma's energy relaxation throughout the system to a steady state. By deepening our understanding of how energy flows through plasmas, we anticipate potential contributions to resolving global environmental issues and fostering technological innovation in plasma-related industrial fields.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-09-12T16:36:22",
        "content": "In matched observational studies, the inferred causal conclusions pretending that matching has taken into account all confounding can be sensitive to unmeasured confounding. In such cases, a sensitivity analysis is often conducted, which investigates whether the observed association between treatment and outcome is due to effects caused by the treatment or it is due to hidden confounding. In general, a sensitivity analysis tries to infer the minimum amount of hidden biases needed in order to explain away the observed association between treatment and outcome, assuming that the treatment has no effect. If the needed bias is large, then the treatment is likely to have significant effects. The Rosenbaum sensitivity analysis is a modern approach for conducting sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies. It investigates what magnitude the maximum of the hidden biases from all matched sets needs to be in order to explain away the observed association, assuming that the treatment has no effect. However, such a sensitivity analysis can be overly conservative and pessimistic, especially when the investigators believe that some matched sets may have exceptionally large hidden biases. In this paper, we generalize Rosenbaum's framework to conduct sensitivity analysis on quantiles of hidden biases from all matched sets, which are more robust than the maximum. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis on all quantiles of hidden biases is simultaneously valid and is thus a free lunch added to the conventional sensitivity analysis. The proposed approach works for general outcomes, general matched studies and general test statistics. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis also works for bounded null hypotheses as long as the test statistic satisfies certain properties. An R package implementing the proposed method is also available online.",

        "content": "Matching is one of the most widely used study designs for adjusting for measured confounders in observational studies. However, unmeasured confounding may exist and cannot be removed by matching. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis is typically needed to assess a causal conclusion's sensitivity to unmeasured confounding. Sensitivity analysis frameworks for binary exposures have been well-established for various matching designs and are commonly used in various studies. However, unlike the binary exposure case, there still lacks valid and general sensitivity analysis methods for continuous exposures, except in some special cases such as pair matching. To fill this gap in the binary outcome case, we develop a sensitivity analysis framework for general matching designs with continuous exposures and binary outcomes. First, we use probabilistic lattice theory to show our sensitivity analysis approach is finite-population-exact under Fisher's sharp null. Second, we prove a novel design sensitivity formula as a powerful tool for asymptotically evaluating the performance of our sensitivity analysis approach. Third, to allow effect heterogeneity with binary outcomes, we introduce a framework for conducting asymptotically exact inference and sensitivity analysis on generalized attributable effects with binary outcomes via mixed-integer programming. Fourth, for the continuous outcomes case, we show that conducting an asymptotically exact sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies when both the exposures and outcomes are continuous is generally NP-hard, except in some special cases such as pair matching. As a real data application, we apply our new methods to study the effect of early-life lead exposure on juvenile delinquency. We also develop a publicly available R package for implementation of the methods in this work.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-03-21T05:57:43",
        "content": "In matched observational studies with binary treatments, the Rosenbaum bounds framework is arguably the most widely used sensitivity analysis framework for assessing sensitivity to unobserved covariates. Unlike the binary treatment case, although widely needed in practice, sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies with treatment doses (i.e., non-binary treatments such as ordinal treatments or continuous treatments) still lacks solid foundations and valid methodologies. We fill in this blank by establishing theoretical foundations and novel methodologies under a generalized Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis framework. First, we present a criterion for assessing the validity of sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies with treatment doses and use that criterion to justify the necessity of incorporating the treatment dose information into sensitivity analysis through generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds. We also generalize Rosenbaum's classic sensitivity parameter $\\Gamma$ to the non-binary treatment case and prove its sufficiency. Second, we study the asymptotic properties of sensitivity analysis by generalizing Rosenbaum's classic design sensitivity and Bahadur efficiency for testing Fisher's sharp null to the non-binary treatment case and deriving novel formulas for them. Our theoretical results showed the importance of appropriately incorporating the treatment dose into a test, which is an intrinsic distinction with the binary treatment case. Third, for testing Neyman's weak null (i.e., null sample average treatment effect), we propose the first valid sensitivity analysis procedure for matching with treatment dose through generalizing an existing optimization-based sensitivity analysis for the binary treatment case, built on the generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds and large-scale mixed integer programming.",

Conversely, Global Sensitivity Analysis is used in numerous contexts to monitor the influence of any feature on an output variable. We reconcile these two domains by showing how Fairness can be seen as a special framework of Global Sensitivity Analysis and how various usual indicators are common between these two fields. We also present new Global Sensitivity Analysis indices, as well as rates of convergence, that are useful as fairness proxies.",

        "content": "In recent years, biomass carbon materials have received widespread attention in the field of electrochemical sensors. As a new type of renewable green energy, biomass carbon has the advantages of low cost and abundant resources. After special treatment, it can be used as an ideal electrode material. Since biomass carbon materials have diverse sources and their morphology is difficult to control, researchers have conducted in-depth research on their preparation process, morphology regulation and application. This review summarizes different biomass carbon structures and their preparation methods and explores the applications of these materials in electrochemical sensors. Modification of biomass carbon materials through pretreatment, physical and chemical activation, heteroatom doping, metal compound composite and other methods can make up for the deficiencies in its pore structure, electrical conductivity and surface wettability, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. The effects of different biomass sources, functional groups, constituent elements and modification methods on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are discussed, and the applications of this type of material in biological molecules, heavy metal ions and pesticide residues are reviewed. Biomass carbon-based materials show great application potential and development prospects in the field of electrochemical sensors.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-09-12T16:36:22",
        "content": "In matched observational studies, the inferred causal conclusions pretending that matching has taken into account all confounding can be sensitive to unmeasured confounding. In such cases, a sensitivity analysis is often conducted, which investigates whether the observed association between treatment and outcome is due to effects caused by the treatment or it is due to hidden confounding. In general, a sensitivity analysis tries to infer the minimum amount of hidden biases needed in order to explain away the observed association between treatment and outcome, assuming that the treatment has no effect. If the needed bias is large, then the treatment is likely to have significant effects. The Rosenbaum sensitivity analysis is a modern approach for conducting sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies. It investigates what magnitude the maximum of the hidden biases from all matched sets needs to be in order to explain away the observed association, assuming that the treatment has no effect. However, such a sensitivity analysis can be overly conservative and pessimistic, especially when the investigators believe that some matched sets may have exceptionally large hidden biases. In this paper, we generalize Rosenbaum's framework to conduct sensitivity analysis on quantiles of hidden biases from all matched sets, which are more robust than the maximum. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis on all quantiles of hidden biases is simultaneously valid and is thus a free lunch added to the conventional sensitivity analysis. The proposed approach works for general outcomes, general matched studies and general test statistics. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis also works for bounded null hypotheses as long as the test statistic satisfies certain properties. An R package implementing the proposed method is also available online.",

        "content": "Significant advancements in hydrogel-based epidermal electrodes have been made in recent years. However, inherent limitations, such as adaptability, adhesion, and conductivity, have presented challenges, thereby limiting the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stability of the physiological-electrode interface. In this study, we propose the concept of myelin sheath-inspired hydrogel epidermal electronics by incorporating numerous interpenetrating core-sheath-structured conductive nanofibers within a physically cross-linked polyelectrolyte network. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated sulfonated cellulose nanofibers (PEDOT:SCNFs) are synthesized through a simple solvent-catalyzed sulfonation process, followed by oxidative self-polymerization and ionic liquid (IL) shielding steps, achieving a low electrochemical impedance of 42 Ω. The physical associations within the composite hydrogel network include complexation, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction, and weak entanglements. These properties confer the hydrogel with high stretchability (770%), superconformability, self-adhesion (28 kPa on pigskin), and self-healing capabilities. By simulating the saltatory propagation effect of the nodes of Ranvier in the nervous system, the biomimetic hydrogel establishes high-fidelity epidermal electronic interfaces, offering benefits such as low interfacial contact impedance, significantly increased SNR (30 dB), as well as large-scale sensor array integration. The advanced biomimetic hydrogel holds tremendous potential for applications in electronic skin (e-skin), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and healthcare assessment devices.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-03-21T05:57:43",
        "content": "In matched observational studies with binary treatments, the Rosenbaum bounds framework is arguably the most widely used sensitivity analysis framework for assessing sensitivity to unobserved covariates. Unlike the binary treatment case, although widely needed in practice, sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies with treatment doses (i.e., non-binary treatments such as ordinal treatments or continuous treatments) still lacks solid foundations and valid methodologies. We fill in this blank by establishing theoretical foundations and novel methodologies under a generalized Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis framework. First, we present a criterion for assessing the validity of sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies with treatment doses and use that criterion to justify the necessity of incorporating the treatment dose information into sensitivity analysis through generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds. We also generalize Rosenbaum's classic sensitivity parameter $\\Gamma$ to the non-binary treatment case and prove its sufficiency. Second, we study the asymptotic properties of sensitivity analysis by generalizing Rosenbaum's classic design sensitivity and Bahadur efficiency for testing Fisher's sharp null to the non-binary treatment case and deriving novel formulas for them. Our theoretical results showed the importance of appropriately incorporating the treatment dose into a test, which is an intrinsic distinction with the binary treatment case. Third, for testing Neyman's weak null (i.e., null sample average treatment effect), we propose the first valid sensitivity analysis procedure for matching with treatment dose through generalizing an existing optimization-based sensitivity analysis for the binary treatment case, built on the generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds and large-scale mixed integer programming.",

        "title": "Deterministic fabrication of graphene hexagonal boron nitride moiré superlattices.",
        "content": "The electronic properties of moiré heterostructures depend sensitively on the relative orientation between layers of the stack. For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a [Formula: see text] ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near-[Formula: see text], not [Formula: see text], relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy of the graphene/hBN moiré on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, nonaligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moiré heterostructures.",

        "content": "The sensitivity analysis of biological system models can significantly contribute to identifying and explaining influences of internal or external changes on model and its elements. We propose here a comprehensive framework to study sensitivity of intra-cellular networks and to identify key intervention pathways, by performing both static and dynamic sensitivity analysis. While the static sensitivity analysis focuses on the impact of network topology and update functions, the dynamic analysis accounts for context-dependent transient state distributions. To study sensitivity, we use discrete models, where each element is represented as a discrete variable and assigned an update rule, which is a function of element's known direct and indirect regulators. Our sensitivity analysis framework allows for assessing the effect of context on individual element sensitivity, as well as on element criticality in reaching preferred outcomes. The framework also enables discovery of most influential pathways in the model that are essential for satisfying important system properties, and thus, could be used for interventions. We discuss the role of nine different network attributes in identifying key elements and intervention pathways, and evaluate their performance using model checking method. Finally, we apply our methods on the model of naive T cell differentiation, and further demonstrate the importance of context-based sensitivity analysis in identifying most influential elements and pathways.",

        "content": "Cow milk (CM) is an important food source for humans, and food allergy caused by CM has attracted attention worldwide. To our knowledge, systematic studies about the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of CM are very rare. In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, and P. pentosaceus fermentation on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability was determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the protein quality, amino acid profile, and color were systematically evaluated. The results showed that these LAB strains exhibited higher protein degradation ability, and the IgE reactivity reduction rate was 41.03%-60.00% and the IgG reduction rate was 29.86%-67.20%, respectively. Additionally, the nutritional value was improved obviously, and the color was altered significantly, which was conductive to develop dairy products. These findings provided a theoretical foundation for the development of hypoallergenic dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus could be considered as good potential candidates for solving cow milk allergy owing to their decreased IgE/IgG binding ability andimproved nutritional and sensory properties, which provide a promising strategy to develop hypoallergenic dairy products.",

As a byproduct, we notably describe a new way of computing correlation ratios for Sobol' indices, which does not require specific experience plans nor rely on independence of the input factors.

Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report here a visible-light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls, though a Norrish type II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction with various non-volatile electron-rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocabonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides, as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1-acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer-based mechanism is proposed.",

In order to keep the sensitivity analysis tractable, we first construct a sparse, high-dimensional polynomial chaos expansion surrogate model for each output quantity of interest, which allows the efficient extraction of sensitivity information. The sensitivity analysis is performed for two problem settings: one for ITER-like conditions, and one that resembles conditions inside the PISCES-A linear plasma device.

Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices.

While most sensitivity analysis methods deal with scalar outputs, this paper introduces a novel approach for performing sensitivity analysis with set-valued outputs. Our innovative methodology is designed for excursion sets, but is versatile enough to be applied to set-valued simulators, including those found in viability fields, or when working with maps like pollutant concentration maps or flood zone maps. We propose to use the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) with a kernel designed for set-valued outputs. After proposing a probabilistic framework for random sets, a first contribution is the proof that this kernel is characteristic, an essential property in a kernel-based sensitivity analysis context. To measure the contribution of each input, we then propose to use HSIC-ANOVA indices. With these indices, we can identify which inputs should be neglected (screening) and we can rank the others according to their influence (ranking). The estimation of these indices is also adapted to the set-valued outputs. Finally, we test the proposed method on three test cases of excursion sets.",

        "content": "Self-assembled polymer grafted nanoparticles (PGNs) are of great interest for their potential to enhance mechanical properties compared to neat polymers and nanocomposites. Apart from volume fraction of nanoparticles, recent experiments have suggested that nanoscale phenomena such as nanoconfinement of grafted chains, altered dynamics and relaxation behavior at the segmental and colloidal scales, and cohesive energy between neighboring coronas are important factors that influence mechanical and rheological properties. How these factors influence the mechanics of thin films subject to micro-ballistic impact remains to be fully understood. Here we examine the micro-ballistic impact resistance of PGN thin films with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grafts using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The grafted chain length and nanoparticle core densities are systematically varied to understand the influences of interparticle spacing, cohesion, and momentum transfer effects under high-velocity impact. Our findings show that the inter-PGN cohesive energy density (",

        "publishedDate": "2023-05-31T11:08:42",
        "content": "In the analysis of prognosis studies with time-to-event outcomes, dichotomization of patients is often made. As the evaluations of prognostic capacity, the survivals of groups with high/low expression of the biomarker are often estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference between groups is summarized via the hazard ratio (HR). The high/low expressions are usually determined by study-specific cutoff values, which brings heterogeneity over multiple prognosis studies and difficulty to synthesizing the results in a simple way. In meta-analysis of diagnostic studies with binary outcomes, the summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) analysis provides a useful cutoff-free summary over studies. Recently, this methodology has been extended to the time-dependent SROC analysis for time-to-event outcomes in meta-analysis of prognosis studies. In this paper, we propose a sensitivity analysis method for evaluating the impact of publication bias on the time-dependent SROC analysis. Our proposal extends the recently introduced sensitivity analysis method for meta-analysis of diagnostic studies based on the bivariate normal model on sensitivity and specificity pairs. To model the selective publication process specific to prognosis studies, we introduce a trivariate model on the time-dependent sensitivity and specificity and the log-transformed HR. Based on the proved asymptotic property of the trivariate model, we introduce a likelihood based sensitivity analysis method based on the conditional likelihood constrained by the expected proportion of published studies. We illustrate the proposed sensitivity analysis method through the meta-analysis of Ki67 for breast cancer. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.",

        "content": "Studies in the existing literature propose that allocryptopine possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showcasing its neuroprotective effects by potentially mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aims to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of allocryptopine on various targets and potential mechanisms that have not been previously explored in the literature. Initially, we used MTT and LDH methods to evaluate the effects of allocryptopine on cell viability in BV-2 cells exposed to LPS-induced damage. Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), other inflammatory mediators (Cox-2 and iNOS), and p38 MAPK genes and proteins through qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Also, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on NF-κB proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p-p50, and p-p65) through ELISA assay. Molecular docking analyses were performed to investigate the potential binding of allocryptopine to target proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p50, p65, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, p38, AP-1 (c-Jun and ATF2), IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Cox-2, and iNOS) associated with the TLR4, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK pathways. Our results indicate that allocryptopine exerts a comprehensive influence on pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and modulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. The outcomes of our study suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy of allocryptopine is intricately linked to the modulation of key molecular pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of allocryptopine as a therapeutic agent for addressing neurodegenerative diseases by safeguarding neuronal health.",

        "publishedDate": "2021-01-14T07:47:40",
        "content": "Global sensitivity analysis is the main quantitative technique for identifying the most influential input variables in a numerical simulation model. In particular when the inputs are independent, Sobol' sensitivity indices attribute a portion of the output of interest variance to each input and all possible interactions in the model, thanks to a functional ANOVA decomposition. On the other hand, moment-independent sensitivity indices focus on the impact of input variables on the whole output distribution instead of the variance only, thus providing complementary insight on the inputs / output relationship. Unfortunately they do not enjoy the nice decomposition property of Sobol' indices and are consequently harder to analyze. In this paper, we introduce two moment-independent indices based on kernel-embeddings of probability distributions and show that the RKHS framework used for their definition makes it possible to exhibit a kernel-based ANOVA decomposition. This is the first time such a desirable property is proved for sensitivity indices apart from Sobol' ones. When the inputs are dependent, we also use these new sensitivity indices as building blocks to design kernel-embedding Shapley effects which generalize the traditional variance-based ones used in sensitivity analysis. Several estimation procedures are discussed and illustrated on test cases with various output types such as categorical variables and probability distributions. All these examples show their potential for enhancing traditional sensitivity analysis with a kernel point of view.",

        "content": "In recent years, biomass carbon materials have received widespread attention in the field of electrochemical sensors. As a new type of renewable green energy, biomass carbon has the advantages of low cost and abundant resources. After special treatment, it can be used as an ideal electrode material. Since biomass carbon materials have diverse sources and their morphology is difficult to control, researchers have conducted in-depth research on their preparation process, morphology regulation and application. This review summarizes different biomass carbon structures and their preparation methods and explores the applications of these materials in electrochemical sensors. Modification of biomass carbon materials through pretreatment, physical and chemical activation, heteroatom doping, metal compound composite and other methods can make up for the deficiencies in its pore structure, electrical conductivity and surface wettability, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. The effects of different biomass sources, functional groups, constituent elements and modification methods on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are discussed, and the applications of this type of material in biological molecules, heavy metal ions and pesticide residues are reviewed. Biomass carbon-based materials show great application potential and development prospects in the field of electrochemical sensors.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-02-26T12:26:27",
        "content": "In 1953, Grothendieck introduced and studied the Dunford--Pettis property (the $DP$ property) and the strict Dunford--Pettis property (the strict $DP$ property). The $DP$ property of order $p\\in[1,\\infty]$ for Banach spaces was introduced by Castillo and Sanchez in 1993. Being motivated by these notions, for $p,q\\in[1,\\infty]$, we define the strict Dunford--Pettis property of order $p$ (the strict $DP_p$ property) and the sequential Dunford--Pettis property of order $(p,q)$ (the sequential $DP_{(p,q)}$ property). We show that a locally convex space (lcs) $E$ has the $DP$ property iff the space $E$ endowed with the Grothendieck topology $\\tau_{\\Sigma'}$ has the weak Glicksberg property, and $E$ has the strict $DP_p$ property iff the space $(E,\\tau_{\\Sigma'}) $ has the $p$-Schur property. We also characterize lcs with the sequential $DP_{(p,q)}$ property. Some permanent properties and relationships between Dunford--Pettis type properties are studied. Numerous (counter)examples are given. In particular, we give the first example of an lcs with the strict $DP$ property but without the $DP$ property and show that the completion of even normed spaces with the $DP$ property may not have the $DP$ property.",

        "content": "Significant advancements in hydrogel-based epidermal electrodes have been made in recent years. However, inherent limitations, such as adaptability, adhesion, and conductivity, have presented challenges, thereby limiting the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stability of the physiological-electrode interface. In this study, we propose the concept of myelin sheath-inspired hydrogel epidermal electronics by incorporating numerous interpenetrating core-sheath-structured conductive nanofibers within a physically cross-linked polyelectrolyte network. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated sulfonated cellulose nanofibers (PEDOT:SCNFs) are synthesized through a simple solvent-catalyzed sulfonation process, followed by oxidative self-polymerization and ionic liquid (IL) shielding steps, achieving a low electrochemical impedance of 42 Ω. The physical associations within the composite hydrogel network include complexation, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction, and weak entanglements. These properties confer the hydrogel with high stretchability (770%), superconformability, self-adhesion (28 kPa on pigskin), and self-healing capabilities. By simulating the saltatory propagation effect of the nodes of Ranvier in the nervous system, the biomimetic hydrogel establishes high-fidelity epidermal electronic interfaces, offering benefits such as low interfacial contact impedance, significantly increased SNR (30 dB), as well as large-scale sensor array integration. The advanced biomimetic hydrogel holds tremendous potential for applications in electronic skin (e-skin), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and healthcare assessment devices.",

        "content": "The electronic properties of moiré heterostructures depend sensitively on the relative orientation between layers of the stack. For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a [Formula: see text] ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near-[Formula: see text], not [Formula: see text], relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy of the graphene/hBN moiré on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, nonaligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moiré heterostructures.",

        "title": "Assessment of the effect of lactic acid bacteria fermentation on IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of cow milk.",
        "content": "Cow milk (CM) is an important food source for humans, and food allergy caused by CM has attracted attention worldwide. To our knowledge, systematic studies about the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of CM are very rare. In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, and P. pentosaceus fermentation on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability was determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the protein quality, amino acid profile, and color were systematically evaluated. The results showed that these LAB strains exhibited higher protein degradation ability, and the IgE reactivity reduction rate was 41.03%-60.00% and the IgG reduction rate was 29.86%-67.20%, respectively. Additionally, the nutritional value was improved obviously, and the color was altered significantly, which was conductive to develop dairy products. These findings provided a theoretical foundation for the development of hypoallergenic dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus could be considered as good potential candidates for solving cow milk allergy owing to their decreased IgE/IgG binding ability andimproved nutritional and sensory properties, which provide a promising strategy to develop hypoallergenic dairy products.",

Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report here a visible-light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls, though a Norrish type II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction with various non-volatile electron-rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocabonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides, as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1-acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer-based mechanism is proposed.",

Their peculiar molecular properties stem from a strong and intimate overlap between the metal centered d orbitals and the p system of the acetylide ligands, resulting in plethora of fascinating properties such as strong and tunable visible light absorption with a strong MLCT character essential for sensing, photovoltaics, light-harvesting applications or non-linear optical properties. Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices. Altogether, we show in this review the potential of RuII acetylide compounds, insisting on the molecular design and suggesting further research developments for this class of organometallic dyes, including supramolecular chemistry.",

        "publishedDate": "2021-08-20T13:46:49",
        "content": "Accurate and efficient valuation of property is of utmost importance in a variety of settings, such as when securing mortgage finance to purchase a property, or where residential property taxes are set as a percentage of a property's resale value. Internationally, resale based property taxes are most common due to ease of implementation and the difficulty of establishing site values. In an Irish context, property valuations are currently based on comparison to recently sold neighbouring properties, however, this approach is limited by low property turnover. National property taxes based on property value, as opposed to site value, also act as a disincentive to improvement works due to the ensuing increased tax burden. In this article we develop a spatial hedonic regression model to separate the spatial and non-spatial contributions of property features to resale value. We mitigate the issue of low property turnover through geographic correlation, borrowing information across multiple property types and finishes. We investigate the impact of address mislabelling on predictive performance, where vendors erroneously supply a more affluent postcode, and evaluate the contribution of improvement works to increased values. Our flexible geo-spatial model outperforms all competitors across a number of different evaluation metrics, including the accuracy of both price prediction and associated uncertainty intervals. While our models are applied in an Irish context, the ability to accurately value properties in markets with low property turnover and to quantify the value contributions of specific property features has widespread application. The ability to separate spatial and non-spatial contributions to a property's value also provides an avenue to site-value based property taxes.",

Apart from volume fraction of nanoparticles, recent experiments have suggested that nanoscale phenomena such as nanoconfinement of grafted chains, altered dynamics and relaxation behavior at the segmental and colloidal scales, and cohesive energy between neighboring coronas are important factors that influence mechanical and rheological properties. How these factors influence the mechanics of thin films subject to micro-ballistic impact remains to be fully understood. Here we examine the micro-ballistic impact resistance of PGN thin films with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grafts using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The grafted chain length and nanoparticle core densities are systematically varied to understand the influences of interparticle spacing, cohesion, and momentum transfer effects under high-velocity impact. Our findings show that the inter-PGN cohesive energy density (",

        "content": "Studies in the existing literature propose that allocryptopine possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showcasing its neuroprotective effects by potentially mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aims to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of allocryptopine on various targets and potential mechanisms that have not been previously explored in the literature. Initially, we used MTT and LDH methods to evaluate the effects of allocryptopine on cell viability in BV-2 cells exposed to LPS-induced damage. Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), other inflammatory mediators (Cox-2 and iNOS), and p38 MAPK genes and proteins through qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Also, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on NF-κB proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p-p50, and p-p65) through ELISA assay. Molecular docking analyses were performed to investigate the potential binding of allocryptopine to target proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p50, p65, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, p38, AP-1 (c-Jun and ATF2), IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Cox-2, and iNOS) associated with the TLR4, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK pathways. Our results indicate that allocryptopine exerts a comprehensive influence on pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and modulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. The outcomes of our study suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy of allocryptopine is intricately linked to the modulation of key molecular pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of allocryptopine as a therapeutic agent for addressing neurodegenerative diseases by safeguarding neuronal health.",

        "content": "Formal software verification uses mathematical techniques to establish that software has certain properties. For example, that the behaviour of a software system satisfies certain logically-specified properties. Formal methods have a long history, but a recurring assumption is that the properties to be verified are known, or provided as part of the requirements elicitation process. This working note considers the question: where do the verification properties come from? It proposes a process for systematically identifying verification properties.",

Specifically, my work answers three research questions: 1) Do different sensitivity analysis (SA) methods yield comparable outputs and attribute importance rankings? 2) Using the same sensitivity analysis method, do different Deep Learning (DL) models impact the output of the sensitivity analysis? 3) How well do the results from sensitivity analysis methods align with the ground truth?",

        "content": "Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a Class C infectious disease that carries particularly high risk for preschool children and is a leading cause of childhood death in some countries. We mimic the periodic outbreak of HFMD over a 2-year period-with differing amplitudes-and propose a dynamic HFMD model that differentiates transmission between mature and immature individuals and uses two possible optimal-control strategies to minimize case numbers, total costs and deaths. We parameterized the model by fitting it to HFMD data in mainland China from January 2011 to December 2018, and the basic reproduction number was estimated as 0.9599. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that transmission between immature and mature individuals contributes substantially to new infections. Increasing the isolation rates of infectious individuals-particularly mature infectious individuals-could greatly reduce the outbreak risk and potentially eradicate the disease in a relatively short time period. It follows that we have a reasonable chance of controlling HFMD if we can reduce transmission in children under 7 and isolate older infectious individuals.",

This study is a preliminary evaluation of graded exposure therapy (GET), which directly targets fear avoidance behaviour, for reducing post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and disability following mTBI. In a historical comparison design, we compared two groups from independent randomized trials. The GET + UC group (N = 34) received GET (delivered over 16 videoconference sessions) in addition to usual care (UC). The historical comparison group (N = 71) received UC only. PCS severity (Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire; RPQ) and disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule; WHODAS 2.0 12-item) were measured at clinic intake (M = 2.7, SD = 1.1 months after injury) and again at M = 4.9 (SD = 1.1) months after injury. Between-group differences were estimated using linear mixed effects regression, with a sensitivity analysis controlling for injury-to-assessment intervals. The estimated average change on the RPQ was -14.3 in the GET + UC group and -5.3 in the UC group. The estimated average change on the WHODAS was -5.3 in the GET + UC group and -3.2 in the UC group. Between-group differences post-treatment were -5.3 on the RPQ and -1.5 on the WHODAS. Treatment effects were larger in sensitivity analyses. Findings suggest that a randomized controlled trial is warranted.",

To illustrate our method, we perform a sensitivity analysis on the effect of unionizing low income workers on the quantiles of the distribution of (log) wages.",

        "content": "A highly versatile evaluation method is proposed for transient plasmas based on statistical physics. It would be beneficial in various industrial sectors, including semiconductors and automobiles. Our research focused on low-energy plasmas in laboratory settings, and they were assessed via our proposed method, which incorporates relative entropy and fractional Brownian motion, based on a revised collisional-radiative model. By introducing an indicator to evaluate how far a system is from its steady state, both the trend of entropy and the radiative process' contribution to the lifetime of excited states were considered. The high statistical weight of some excited states may act as a bottleneck in the plasma's energy relaxation throughout the system to a steady state. By deepening our understanding of how energy flows through plasmas, we anticipate potential contributions to resolving global environmental issues and fostering technological innovation in plasma-related industrial fields.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-09-12T16:36:22",
        "content": "In matched observational studies, the inferred causal conclusions pretending that matching has taken into account all confounding can be sensitive to unmeasured confounding. In such cases, a sensitivity analysis is often conducted, which investigates whether the observed association between treatment and outcome is due to effects caused by the treatment or it is due to hidden confounding. In general, a sensitivity analysis tries to infer the minimum amount of hidden biases needed in order to explain away the observed association between treatment and outcome, assuming that the treatment has no effect. If the needed bias is large, then the treatment is likely to have significant effects. The Rosenbaum sensitivity analysis is a modern approach for conducting sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies. It investigates what magnitude the maximum of the hidden biases from all matched sets needs to be in order to explain away the observed association, assuming that the treatment has no effect. However, such a sensitivity analysis can be overly conservative and pessimistic, especially when the investigators believe that some matched sets may have exceptionally large hidden biases. In this paper, we generalize Rosenbaum's framework to conduct sensitivity analysis on quantiles of hidden biases from all matched sets, which are more robust than the maximum. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis on all quantiles of hidden biases is simultaneously valid and is thus a free lunch added to the conventional sensitivity analysis. The proposed approach works for general outcomes, general matched studies and general test statistics. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis also works for bounded null hypotheses as long as the test statistic satisfies certain properties. An R package implementing the proposed method is also available online.",

We study the special case of absence of symmetry induced by a group of scaling transformations of the continuous distribution of frequencies. When coupling between oscillators is increased beyond a critical threshold favoring spontaneous synchronization, we found that the variation in the velocity of the traveling wave depends on the extent of asymmetry in the natural frequency distribution. In particular for large coupling this velocity is the average natural frequency whereas at the onset of synchronization it corresponds to the frequency where the Hilbert Transform of the frequency distribution vanishes.",

About one billion people worldwide are estimated to have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. Vitamin D deficiency is common among people with COPD, and has been reported to be associated with reduced lung function and increased risk of acute exacerbations of COPD. Several clinical trials of vitamin D to prevent acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) and improve COPD control have been conducted, but an up-to-date meta-analysis of all double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of this intervention is lacking.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-01-12T21:49:25",
        "content": "Matching is one of the most widely used study designs for adjusting for measured confounders in observational studies. However, unmeasured confounding may exist and cannot be removed by matching. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis is typically needed to assess a causal conclusion's sensitivity to unmeasured confounding. Sensitivity analysis frameworks for binary exposures have been well-established for various matching designs and are commonly used in various studies. However, unlike the binary exposure case, there still lacks valid and general sensitivity analysis methods for continuous exposures, except in some special cases such as pair matching. To fill this gap in the binary outcome case, we develop a sensitivity analysis framework for general matching designs with continuous exposures and binary outcomes. First, we use probabilistic lattice theory to show our sensitivity analysis approach is finite-population-exact under Fisher's sharp null. Second, we prove a novel design sensitivity formula as a powerful tool for asymptotically evaluating the performance of our sensitivity analysis approach. Third, to allow effect heterogeneity with binary outcomes, we introduce a framework for conducting asymptotically exact inference and sensitivity analysis on generalized attributable effects with binary outcomes via mixed-integer programming. Fourth, for the continuous outcomes case, we show that conducting an asymptotically exact sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies when both the exposures and outcomes are continuous is generally NP-hard, except in some special cases such as pair matching. As a real data application, we apply our new methods to study the effect of early-life lead exposure on juvenile delinquency. We also develop a publicly available R package for implementation of the methods in this work.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-03-21T05:57:43",
        "content": "In matched observational studies with binary treatments, the Rosenbaum bounds framework is arguably the most widely used sensitivity analysis framework for assessing sensitivity to unobserved covariates. Unlike the binary treatment case, although widely needed in practice, sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies with treatment doses (i.e., non-binary treatments such as ordinal treatments or continuous treatments) still lacks solid foundations and valid methodologies. We fill in this blank by establishing theoretical foundations and novel methodologies under a generalized Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis framework. First, we present a criterion for assessing the validity of sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies with treatment doses and use that criterion to justify the necessity of incorporating the treatment dose information into sensitivity analysis through generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds. We also generalize Rosenbaum's classic sensitivity parameter $\\Gamma$ to the non-binary treatment case and prove its sufficiency. Second, we study the asymptotic properties of sensitivity analysis by generalizing Rosenbaum's classic design sensitivity and Bahadur efficiency for testing Fisher's sharp null to the non-binary treatment case and deriving novel formulas for them. Our theoretical results showed the importance of appropriately incorporating the treatment dose into a test, which is an intrinsic distinction with the binary treatment case. Third, for testing Neyman's weak null (i.e., null sample average treatment effect), we propose the first valid sensitivity analysis procedure for matching with treatment dose through generalizing an existing optimization-based sensitivity analysis for the binary treatment case, built on the generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds and large-scale mixed integer programming.",

        "content": "In recent years, biomass carbon materials have received widespread attention in the field of electrochemical sensors. As a new type of renewable green energy, biomass carbon has the advantages of low cost and abundant resources. After special treatment, it can be used as an ideal electrode material. Since biomass carbon materials have diverse sources and their morphology is difficult to control, researchers have conducted in-depth research on their preparation process, morphology regulation and application. This review summarizes different biomass carbon structures and their preparation methods and explores the applications of these materials in electrochemical sensors. Modification of biomass carbon materials through pretreatment, physical and chemical activation, heteroatom doping, metal compound composite and other methods can make up for the deficiencies in its pore structure, electrical conductivity and surface wettability, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. The effects of different biomass sources, functional groups, constituent elements and modification methods on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are discussed, and the applications of this type of material in biological molecules, heavy metal ions and pesticide residues are reviewed. Biomass carbon-based materials show great application potential and development prospects in the field of electrochemical sensors.",

        "content": "Significant advancements in hydrogel-based epidermal electrodes have been made in recent years. However, inherent limitations, such as adaptability, adhesion, and conductivity, have presented challenges, thereby limiting the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stability of the physiological-electrode interface. In this study, we propose the concept of myelin sheath-inspired hydrogel epidermal electronics by incorporating numerous interpenetrating core-sheath-structured conductive nanofibers within a physically cross-linked polyelectrolyte network. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated sulfonated cellulose nanofibers (PEDOT:SCNFs) are synthesized through a simple solvent-catalyzed sulfonation process, followed by oxidative self-polymerization and ionic liquid (IL) shielding steps, achieving a low electrochemical impedance of 42 Ω. The physical associations within the composite hydrogel network include complexation, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction, and weak entanglements. These properties confer the hydrogel with high stretchability (770%), superconformability, self-adhesion (28 kPa on pigskin), and self-healing capabilities. By simulating the saltatory propagation effect of the nodes of Ranvier in the nervous system, the biomimetic hydrogel establishes high-fidelity epidermal electronic interfaces, offering benefits such as low interfacial contact impedance, significantly increased SNR (30 dB), as well as large-scale sensor array integration. The advanced biomimetic hydrogel holds tremendous potential for applications in electronic skin (e-skin), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and healthcare assessment devices.",

        "title": "Deterministic fabrication of graphene hexagonal boron nitride moiré superlattices.",
        "content": "The electronic properties of moiré heterostructures depend sensitively on the relative orientation between layers of the stack. For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a [Formula: see text] ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near-[Formula: see text], not [Formula: see text], relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy of the graphene/hBN moiré on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, nonaligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moiré heterostructures.",

        "content": "Cow milk (CM) is an important food source for humans, and food allergy caused by CM has attracted attention worldwide. To our knowledge, systematic studies about the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of CM are very rare. In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, and P. pentosaceus fermentation on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability was determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the protein quality, amino acid profile, and color were systematically evaluated. The results showed that these LAB strains exhibited higher protein degradation ability, and the IgE reactivity reduction rate was 41.03%-60.00% and the IgG reduction rate was 29.86%-67.20%, respectively. Additionally, the nutritional value was improved obviously, and the color was altered significantly, which was conductive to develop dairy products. These findings provided a theoretical foundation for the development of hypoallergenic dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus could be considered as good potential candidates for solving cow milk allergy owing to their decreased IgE/IgG binding ability andimproved nutritional and sensory properties, which provide a promising strategy to develop hypoallergenic dairy products.",

Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report here a visible-light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls, though a Norrish type II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction with various non-volatile electron-rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocabonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides, as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1-acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer-based mechanism is proposed.",

Their peculiar molecular properties stem from a strong and intimate overlap between the metal centered d orbitals and the p system of the acetylide ligands, resulting in plethora of fascinating properties such as strong and tunable visible light absorption with a strong MLCT character essential for sensing, photovoltaics, light-harvesting applications or non-linear optical properties. Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices. Altogether, we show in this review the potential of RuII acetylide compounds, insisting on the molecular design and suggesting further research developments for this class of organometallic dyes, including supramolecular chemistry.",

        "content": "Self-assembled polymer grafted nanoparticles (PGNs) are of great interest for their potential to enhance mechanical properties compared to neat polymers and nanocomposites. Apart from volume fraction of nanoparticles, recent experiments have suggested that nanoscale phenomena such as nanoconfinement of grafted chains, altered dynamics and relaxation behavior at the segmental and colloidal scales, and cohesive energy between neighboring coronas are important factors that influence mechanical and rheological properties. How these factors influence the mechanics of thin films subject to micro-ballistic impact remains to be fully understood. Here we examine the micro-ballistic impact resistance of PGN thin films with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grafts using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The grafted chain length and nanoparticle core densities are systematically varied to understand the influences of interparticle spacing, cohesion, and momentum transfer effects under high-velocity impact. Our findings show that the inter-PGN cohesive energy density (",

        "content": "Studies in the existing literature propose that allocryptopine possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showcasing its neuroprotective effects by potentially mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aims to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of allocryptopine on various targets and potential mechanisms that have not been previously explored in the literature. Initially, we used MTT and LDH methods to evaluate the effects of allocryptopine on cell viability in BV-2 cells exposed to LPS-induced damage. Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), other inflammatory mediators (Cox-2 and iNOS), and p38 MAPK genes and proteins through qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Also, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on NF-κB proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p-p50, and p-p65) through ELISA assay. Molecular docking analyses were performed to investigate the potential binding of allocryptopine to target proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p50, p65, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, p38, AP-1 (c-Jun and ATF2), IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Cox-2, and iNOS) associated with the TLR4, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK pathways. Our results indicate that allocryptopine exerts a comprehensive influence on pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and modulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. The outcomes of our study suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy of allocryptopine is intricately linked to the modulation of key molecular pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of allocryptopine as a therapeutic agent for addressing neurodegenerative diseases by safeguarding neuronal health.",

        "content": "In recent years, biomass carbon materials have received widespread attention in the field of electrochemical sensors. As a new type of renewable green energy, biomass carbon has the advantages of low cost and abundant resources. After special treatment, it can be used as an ideal electrode material. Since biomass carbon materials have diverse sources and their morphology is difficult to control, researchers have conducted in-depth research on their preparation process, morphology regulation and application. This review summarizes different biomass carbon structures and their preparation methods and explores the applications of these materials in electrochemical sensors. Modification of biomass carbon materials through pretreatment, physical and chemical activation, heteroatom doping, metal compound composite and other methods can make up for the deficiencies in its pore structure, electrical conductivity and surface wettability, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. The effects of different biomass sources, functional groups, constituent elements and modification methods on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are discussed, and the applications of this type of material in biological molecules, heavy metal ions and pesticide residues are reviewed. Biomass carbon-based materials show great application potential and development prospects in the field of electrochemical sensors.",

        "content": "Operational modal analysis (OMA) aims at identifying the modal properties of a structure based on response data of the structure excited by ambient sources. Modal parameters of the ambient vibration structures consist of natural frequencies, mode shapes, and modal damping ratios. In this paper, a typical frame with arbitrary loading has been modeled in finite element software, ANSYS, and the responses (accelerations of nodes) have been achieved. By using these data and the codes written in MATLAB, the modal parameters (natural frequencies, mode shapes) of the beams are identified with FDD (Frequency Domain Decomposition) and PP (Peak Picking) methods and then justified with the results of input-output method which was determined by modal analysis. The results indicate that there is a good agreement between three methods for determining the dynamic characteristics of frames. Then, the minimum number of required accelerometer has been determined that recording the acceleration in that location leads to identifying all the natural frequencies of the frame.",

        "content": "Significant advancements in hydrogel-based epidermal electrodes have been made in recent years. However, inherent limitations, such as adaptability, adhesion, and conductivity, have presented challenges, thereby limiting the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stability of the physiological-electrode interface. In this study, we propose the concept of myelin sheath-inspired hydrogel epidermal electronics by incorporating numerous interpenetrating core-sheath-structured conductive nanofibers within a physically cross-linked polyelectrolyte network. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated sulfonated cellulose nanofibers (PEDOT:SCNFs) are synthesized through a simple solvent-catalyzed sulfonation process, followed by oxidative self-polymerization and ionic liquid (IL) shielding steps, achieving a low electrochemical impedance of 42 Ω. The physical associations within the composite hydrogel network include complexation, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction, and weak entanglements. These properties confer the hydrogel with high stretchability (770%), superconformability, self-adhesion (28 kPa on pigskin), and self-healing capabilities. By simulating the saltatory propagation effect of the nodes of Ranvier in the nervous system, the biomimetic hydrogel establishes high-fidelity epidermal electronic interfaces, offering benefits such as low interfacial contact impedance, significantly increased SNR (30 dB), as well as large-scale sensor array integration. The advanced biomimetic hydrogel holds tremendous potential for applications in electronic skin (e-skin), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and healthcare assessment devices.",

        "content": "The paper studies the topological changes from before and after cointegration, for the natural frequencies of the Z24 Bridge. The second natural frequency is known to be nonlinear in temperature, and this will serve as the main focal point of this work. Cointegration is a method of normalising time series data with respect to one another - often strongly-correlated time series. Cointegration is used in this paper to remove effects from Environmental and Operational Variations, by cointegrating the first four natural frequencies for the Z24 Bridge data. The temperature effects on the natural frequency data are clearly visible within the data, and it is desirable, for the purposes of structural health monitoring, that these effects are removed. The univariate time series are embedded in higher-dimensional space, such that interesting topologies are formed. Topological data analysis is used to analyse the raw time series, and the cointegrated equivalents. A standard topological data analysis pipeline is enacted, where simplicial complexes are constructed from the embedded point clouds. Topological properties are then calculated from the simplicial complexes; such as the persistent homology. The persistent homology is then analysed, to determine the topological structure of all the time series.",

        "title": "Deterministic fabrication of graphene hexagonal boron nitride moiré superlattices.",
        "content": "The electronic properties of moiré heterostructures depend sensitively on the relative orientation between layers of the stack. For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a [Formula: see text] ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near-[Formula: see text], not [Formula: see text], relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy of the graphene/hBN moiré on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, nonaligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moiré heterostructures.",

        "content": "Globally coupled ensembles of phase oscillators serve as useful tools for modeling synchronization and collective behavior in a variety of applications. As interest in the effects of simplicial interactions (i.e., non-additive, higher-order interactions between three or more units) continues to grow we study an extension of the Kuramoto model where oscillators are coupled via three-way interactions that exhibits novel dynamical properties including clustering, multistability, and abrupt desynchronization transitions. Here we provide a rigorous description of the stability of various multicluster states by studying their spectral properties in the thermodynamic limit. Not unlike the classical Kuramoto model, a natural frequency distribution with infinite support yields a population of drifting oscillators, which in turn guarantees that a portion of the spectrum is located on the imaginary axes, resulting in neutrally stable or unstable solutions. On the other hand, a natural frequency distribution with finite support allows for a fully phase-locked state, whose spectrum is real and may be linearly stable or unstable.",

        "content": "Cow milk (CM) is an important food source for humans, and food allergy caused by CM has attracted attention worldwide. To our knowledge, systematic studies about the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of CM are very rare. In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, and P. pentosaceus fermentation on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability was determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the protein quality, amino acid profile, and color were systematically evaluated. The results showed that these LAB strains exhibited higher protein degradation ability, and the IgE reactivity reduction rate was 41.03%-60.00% and the IgG reduction rate was 29.86%-67.20%, respectively. Additionally, the nutritional value was improved obviously, and the color was altered significantly, which was conductive to develop dairy products. These findings provided a theoretical foundation for the development of hypoallergenic dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus could be considered as good potential candidates for solving cow milk allergy owing to their decreased IgE/IgG binding ability andimproved nutritional and sensory properties, which provide a promising strategy to develop hypoallergenic dairy products.",

        "content": "Synchronization of network-coupled dynamical units is important to a variety of natural and engineered processes including circadian rhythms, cardiac function, neural processing, and power grids. Despite this ubiquity, it remains poorly understood how complex network structures and heterogeneous local dynamics combine to either promote or inhibit synchronization. Moreover, for most real-world applications it is impossible to obtain the exact specifications of the system, and there is a lack of theory for how uncertainty affects synchronization. We address this open problem by studying the Synchrony Alignment Function (SAF), which is an objective measure for the synchronization properties of a network of heterogeneous oscillators with given natural frequencies. We extend the SAF framework to analyze network-coupled oscillators with heterogeneous natural frequencies that are drawn as a multivariate random vector. Using probability theory for quadratic forms, we obtain expressions for the expectation and variance of the SAF for given network structures. We conclude with numerical experiments that illustrate how the incorporation of uncertainty yields a more robust theoretical framework for enhancing synchronization, and we provide new perspectives for why synchronization is generically promoted by network properties including degree-frequency correlations, link directedness, and link weight delocalization.",

Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report here a visible-light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls, though a Norrish type II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction with various non-volatile electron-rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocabonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides, as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1-acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer-based mechanism is proposed.",

        "content": "Efficient and accurate numerical algorithms are developed to solve a generalized Kirchhoff-Love plate model subject to three common physical boundary conditions: (i) clamped; (ii) simply supported; and (iii) free. We solve the model equation by discretizing the spatial derivatives using second-order finite-difference schemes, and then advancing the semi-discrete problem in time with either an explicit predictor-corrector or an implicit Newmark-Beta time-stepping algorithm. Stability analysis is conducted for the schemes and the results are used to determine stable time steps in practice. A series of carefully chosen test problems are solved to demonstrate the properties and applications of our numerical approaches. The numerical results confirm the stability and 2nd-order accuracy of the algorithms, and are also comparable with experiments for similar thin plates. As an application, we illustrate a strategy to identify the natural frequencies of a plate using our numerical methods in conjunction with a fast Fourier transformation (FFT) power spectrum analysis of the computed data. Then we take advantage of one of the computed natural frequencies to simulate the interesting physical phenomena known as resonance and beat for a generalized Kirchhoff-Love plate.",

        "content": "In this contribution, we describe the various research domains in which RuII alkynyl derivatives are involved. Their peculiar molecular properties stem from a strong and intimate overlap between the metal centered d orbitals and the p system of the acetylide ligands, resulting in plethora of fascinating properties such as strong and tunable visible light absorption with a strong MLCT character essential for sensing, photovoltaics, light-harvesting applications or non-linear optical properties. Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices. Altogether, we show in this review the potential of RuII acetylide compounds, insisting on the molecular design and suggesting further research developments for this class of organometallic dyes, including supramolecular chemistry.",

Apart from volume fraction of nanoparticles, recent experiments have suggested that nanoscale phenomena such as nanoconfinement of grafted chains, altered dynamics and relaxation behavior at the segmental and colloidal scales, and cohesive energy between neighboring coronas are important factors that influence mechanical and rheological properties. How these factors influence the mechanics of thin films subject to micro-ballistic impact remains to be fully understood. Here we examine the micro-ballistic impact resistance of PGN thin films with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grafts using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The grafted chain length and nanoparticle core densities are systematically varied to understand the influences of interparticle spacing, cohesion, and momentum transfer effects under high-velocity impact. Our findings show that the inter-PGN cohesive energy density (",

        "content": "This paper introduces a novel design method that enhances the force/torque, bendability, and controllability of soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs). The complex structure of the soft actuator is simplified by approximating it as a cantilever beam. This allows us to derive approximated nonlinear kinematic models and a dynamical model, which is explored to understand the correlation between natural frequency and dimensional parameters of SPA. The design problem is then transformed into an optimization problem, using kinematic equations as the objective function and the dynamical equation as a constraint. By solving this optimization problem, the optimal dimensional parameters are determined. Six prototypes are manufactured to validate the proposed approach. The optimal actuator successfully generates the desired force/torque and bending angle, while its natural frequency remains within the constrained range. This work highlights the potential of using optimization formulation and approximated nonlinear models to boost the performance and dynamical properties of soft pneumatic actuators.",

        "content": "Studies in the existing literature propose that allocryptopine possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showcasing its neuroprotective effects by potentially mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aims to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of allocryptopine on various targets and potential mechanisms that have not been previously explored in the literature. Initially, we used MTT and LDH methods to evaluate the effects of allocryptopine on cell viability in BV-2 cells exposed to LPS-induced damage. Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), other inflammatory mediators (Cox-2 and iNOS), and p38 MAPK genes and proteins through qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Also, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on NF-κB proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p-p50, and p-p65) through ELISA assay. Molecular docking analyses were performed to investigate the potential binding of allocryptopine to target proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p50, p65, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, p38, AP-1 (c-Jun and ATF2), IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Cox-2, and iNOS) associated with the TLR4, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK pathways. Our results indicate that allocryptopine exerts a comprehensive influence on pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and modulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. The outcomes of our study suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy of allocryptopine is intricately linked to the modulation of key molecular pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of allocryptopine as a therapeutic agent for addressing neurodegenerative diseases by safeguarding neuronal health.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-08-16T11:11:56",
        "content": "In the field of operational modal analysis (OMA), obtained modal information is frequently used to assess the current state of aerospace, mechanical, offshore and civil structures. However, the stochasticity of operational systems and the lack of forcing information can lead to inconsistent results. Quantifying the uncertainty of the recovered modal parameters through OMA is therefore of significant value. In this article, a new perspective on Bayesian OMA is proposed: a Bayesian stochastic subspace identification (SSI) algorithm. Distinct from existing approaches to Bayesian OMA, a hierarchical probabilistic model is embedded at the core of covariance-driven SSI. Through substitution of canonical correlation analysis with a Bayesian equivalent, posterior distributions over the modal properties are obtained. Two inference schemes are presented for the proposed Bayesian formulation: Markov Chain Monte Carlo and variational Bayes. Two case studies are then explored. The first is benchmark study using data from a simulated, multi degree-of-freedom, linear system. Following application of Bayesian SSI, it is shown that the same posterior is targeted and recovered by both inference schemes, with good agreement between the posterior mean and the conventional SSI result. The second study applies the variational form to data obtained from an in-service structure: The Z24 bridge. The results of this study are presented at single model orders, and then using a stabilisation diagram. The recovered posterior uncertainty is presented and compared to the classic SSI result. It is observed that the posterior distributions with mean values coinciding with the natural frequencies exhibit lower variance than values situated away from the natural frequencies.",

        "publishedDate": "2022-01-18T04:52:08",
        "content": "Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is one of the most widely explored additive manufacturing method that uses thermoplastic materials to manufacture products. Mechanical properties of parts manufactured using FDM are influenced by different process parameters involved during manufacturing as they impact the bonding among different layers of cross-section. In this study, the effect of infill patterns and build orientations on the mechanical properties of PLA based parts manufactured using FDM method is studied. Six different infill patterns (triangles, cubic, concentric, tetrahedral, lines, and zigzag) and three different orientations (flatwise, edgewise, and upright) are considered for rectangular beam type parts. For determining mechanical properties of parts with different infill patterns and orientations, flexural bending test is performed. Experimental modal analysis of manufactured parts is performed to observe the relation of natural frequencies with elastic modulus of the parts obtained from flexural bending test. The possibility of experimental modal analysis as an alternative non-destructive method for testing mechanical properties of FDM 3D printed parts is explored.",

        "content": "In recent years, biomass carbon materials have received widespread attention in the field of electrochemical sensors. As a new type of renewable green energy, biomass carbon has the advantages of low cost and abundant resources. After special treatment, it can be used as an ideal electrode material. Since biomass carbon materials have diverse sources and their morphology is difficult to control, researchers have conducted in-depth research on their preparation process, morphology regulation and application. This review summarizes different biomass carbon structures and their preparation methods and explores the applications of these materials in electrochemical sensors. Modification of biomass carbon materials through pretreatment, physical and chemical activation, heteroatom doping, metal compound composite and other methods can make up for the deficiencies in its pore structure, electrical conductivity and surface wettability, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. The effects of different biomass sources, functional groups, constituent elements and modification methods on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are discussed, and the applications of this type of material in biological molecules, heavy metal ions and pesticide residues are reviewed. Biomass carbon-based materials show great application potential and development prospects in the field of electrochemical sensors.",

        "content": "Significant advancements in hydrogel-based epidermal electrodes have been made in recent years. However, inherent limitations, such as adaptability, adhesion, and conductivity, have presented challenges, thereby limiting the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stability of the physiological-electrode interface. In this study, we propose the concept of myelin sheath-inspired hydrogel epidermal electronics by incorporating numerous interpenetrating core-sheath-structured conductive nanofibers within a physically cross-linked polyelectrolyte network. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated sulfonated cellulose nanofibers (PEDOT:SCNFs) are synthesized through a simple solvent-catalyzed sulfonation process, followed by oxidative self-polymerization and ionic liquid (IL) shielding steps, achieving a low electrochemical impedance of 42 Ω. The physical associations within the composite hydrogel network include complexation, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction, and weak entanglements. These properties confer the hydrogel with high stretchability (770%), superconformability, self-adhesion (28 kPa on pigskin), and self-healing capabilities. By simulating the saltatory propagation effect of the nodes of Ranvier in the nervous system, the biomimetic hydrogel establishes high-fidelity epidermal electronic interfaces, offering benefits such as low interfacial contact impedance, significantly increased SNR (30 dB), as well as large-scale sensor array integration. The advanced biomimetic hydrogel holds tremendous potential for applications in electronic skin (e-skin), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and healthcare assessment devices.",

        "content": "The electronic properties of moiré heterostructures depend sensitively on the relative orientation between layers of the stack. For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a [Formula: see text] ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near-[Formula: see text], not [Formula: see text], relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy of the graphene/hBN moiré on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, nonaligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moiré heterostructures.",

        "title": "Assessment of the effect of lactic acid bacteria fermentation on IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of cow milk.",
        "content": "Cow milk (CM) is an important food source for humans, and food allergy caused by CM has attracted attention worldwide. To our knowledge, systematic studies about the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of CM are very rare. In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, and P. pentosaceus fermentation on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability was determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the protein quality, amino acid profile, and color were systematically evaluated. The results showed that these LAB strains exhibited higher protein degradation ability, and the IgE reactivity reduction rate was 41.03%-60.00% and the IgG reduction rate was 29.86%-67.20%, respectively. Additionally, the nutritional value was improved obviously, and the color was altered significantly, which was conductive to develop dairy products. These findings provided a theoretical foundation for the development of hypoallergenic dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus could be considered as good potential candidates for solving cow milk allergy owing to their decreased IgE/IgG binding ability andimproved nutritional and sensory properties, which provide a promising strategy to develop hypoallergenic dairy products.",

        "content": "The thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction represents one of the straightforward approaches to build thietane cores. Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report here a visible-light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls, though a Norrish type II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction with various non-volatile electron-rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocabonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides, as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1-acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer-based mechanism is proposed.",

        "content": "In this contribution, we describe the various research domains in which RuII alkynyl derivatives are involved. Their peculiar molecular properties stem from a strong and intimate overlap between the metal centered d orbitals and the p system of the acetylide ligands, resulting in plethora of fascinating properties such as strong and tunable visible light absorption with a strong MLCT character essential for sensing, photovoltaics, light-harvesting applications or non-linear optical properties. Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices. Altogether, we show in this review the potential of RuII acetylide compounds, insisting on the molecular design and suggesting further research developments for this class of organometallic dyes, including supramolecular chemistry.",

Apart from volume fraction of nanoparticles, recent experiments have suggested that nanoscale phenomena such as nanoconfinement of grafted chains, altered dynamics and relaxation behavior at the segmental and colloidal scales, and cohesive energy between neighboring coronas are important factors that influence mechanical and rheological properties. How these factors influence the mechanics of thin films subject to micro-ballistic impact remains to be fully understood. Here we examine the micro-ballistic impact resistance of PGN thin films with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grafts using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The grafted chain length and nanoparticle core densities are systematically varied to understand the influences of interparticle spacing, cohesion, and momentum transfer effects under high-velocity impact. Our findings show that the inter-PGN cohesive energy density (",

        "content": "Studies in the existing literature propose that allocryptopine possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showcasing its neuroprotective effects by potentially mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aims to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of allocryptopine on various targets and potential mechanisms that have not been previously explored in the literature. Initially, we used MTT and LDH methods to evaluate the effects of allocryptopine on cell viability in BV-2 cells exposed to LPS-induced damage. Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), other inflammatory mediators (Cox-2 and iNOS), and p38 MAPK genes and proteins through qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Also, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on NF-κB proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p-p50, and p-p65) through ELISA assay. Molecular docking analyses were performed to investigate the potential binding of allocryptopine to target proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p50, p65, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, p38, AP-1 (c-Jun and ATF2), IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Cox-2, and iNOS) associated with the TLR4, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK pathways. Our results indicate that allocryptopine exerts a comprehensive influence on pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and modulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. The outcomes of our study suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy of allocryptopine is intricately linked to the modulation of key molecular pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of allocryptopine as a therapeutic agent for addressing neurodegenerative diseases by safeguarding neuronal health.",

        "content": "Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a Class C infectious disease that carries particularly high risk for preschool children and is a leading cause of childhood death in some countries. We mimic the periodic outbreak of HFMD over a 2-year period-with differing amplitudes-and propose a dynamic HFMD model that differentiates transmission between mature and immature individuals and uses two possible optimal-control strategies to minimize case numbers, total costs and deaths. We parameterized the model by fitting it to HFMD data in mainland China from January 2011 to December 2018, and the basic reproduction number was estimated as 0.9599. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that transmission between immature and mature individuals contributes substantially to new infections. Increasing the isolation rates of infectious individuals-particularly mature infectious individuals-could greatly reduce the outbreak risk and potentially eradicate the disease in a relatively short time period. It follows that we have a reasonable chance of controlling HFMD if we can reduce transmission in children under 7 and isolate older infectious individuals.",

This study is a preliminary evaluation of graded exposure therapy (GET), which directly targets fear avoidance behaviour, for reducing post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and disability following mTBI. In a historical comparison design, we compared two groups from independent randomized trials. The GET + UC group (N = 34) received GET (delivered over 16 videoconference sessions) in addition to usual care (UC). The historical comparison group (N = 71) received UC only. PCS severity (Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire; RPQ) and disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule; WHODAS 2.0 12-item) were measured at clinic intake (M = 2.7, SD = 1.1 months after injury) and again at M = 4.9 (SD = 1.1) months after injury. Between-group differences were estimated using linear mixed effects regression, with a sensitivity analysis controlling for injury-to-assessment intervals. The estimated average change on the RPQ was -14.3 in the GET + UC group and -5.3 in the UC group. The estimated average change on the WHODAS was -5.3 in the GET + UC group and -3.2 in the UC group. Between-group differences post-treatment were -5.3 on the RPQ and -1.5 on the WHODAS. Treatment effects were larger in sensitivity analyses. Findings suggest that a randomized controlled trial is warranted.",

It would be beneficial in various industrial sectors, including semiconductors and automobiles. Our research focused on low-energy plasmas in laboratory settings, and they were assessed via our proposed method, which incorporates relative entropy and fractional Brownian motion, based on a revised collisional-radiative model. By introducing an indicator to evaluate how far a system is from its steady state, both the trend of entropy and the radiative process' contribution to the lifetime of excited states were considered. The high statistical weight of some excited states may act as a bottleneck in the plasma's energy relaxation throughout the system to a steady state. By deepening our understanding of how energy flows through plasmas, we anticipate potential contributions to resolving global environmental issues and fostering technological innovation in plasma-related industrial fields.",

        "content": "In recent years, biomass carbon materials have received widespread attention in the field of electrochemical sensors. As a new type of renewable green energy, biomass carbon has the advantages of low cost and abundant resources. After special treatment, it can be used as an ideal electrode material. Since biomass carbon materials have diverse sources and their morphology is difficult to control, researchers have conducted in-depth research on their preparation process, morphology regulation and application. This review summarizes different biomass carbon structures and their preparation methods and explores the applications of these materials in electrochemical sensors. Modification of biomass carbon materials through pretreatment, physical and chemical activation, heteroatom doping, metal compound composite and other methods can make up for the deficiencies in its pore structure, electrical conductivity and surface wettability, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. The effects of different biomass sources, functional groups, constituent elements and modification methods on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are discussed, and the applications of this type of material in biological molecules, heavy metal ions and pesticide residues are reviewed. Biomass carbon-based materials show great application potential and development prospects in the field of electrochemical sensors.",

        "title": "Sensitivity Analysis for Quantiles of Hidden Biases in Matched Observational Studies",
        "publishedDate": "2023-09-12T16:36:22",
        "content": "In matched observational studies, the inferred causal conclusions pretending that matching has taken into account all confounding can be sensitive to unmeasured confounding. In such cases, a sensitivity analysis is often conducted, which investigates whether the observed association between treatment and outcome is due to effects caused by the treatment or it is due to hidden confounding. In general, a sensitivity analysis tries to infer the minimum amount of hidden biases needed in order to explain away the observed association between treatment and outcome, assuming that the treatment has no effect. If the needed bias is large, then the treatment is likely to have significant effects. The Rosenbaum sensitivity analysis is a modern approach for conducting sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies. It investigates what magnitude the maximum of the hidden biases from all matched sets needs to be in order to explain away the observed association, assuming that the treatment has no effect. However, such a sensitivity analysis can be overly conservative and pessimistic, especially when the investigators believe that some matched sets may have exceptionally large hidden biases. In this paper, we generalize Rosenbaum's framework to conduct sensitivity analysis on quantiles of hidden biases from all matched sets, which are more robust than the maximum. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis on all quantiles of hidden biases is simultaneously valid and is thus a free lunch added to the conventional sensitivity analysis. The proposed approach works for general outcomes, general matched studies and general test statistics. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis also works for bounded null hypotheses as long as the test statistic satisfies certain properties. An R package implementing the proposed method is also available online.",

        "content": "Significant advancements in hydrogel-based epidermal electrodes have been made in recent years. However, inherent limitations, such as adaptability, adhesion, and conductivity, have presented challenges, thereby limiting the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stability of the physiological-electrode interface. In this study, we propose the concept of myelin sheath-inspired hydrogel epidermal electronics by incorporating numerous interpenetrating core-sheath-structured conductive nanofibers within a physically cross-linked polyelectrolyte network. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated sulfonated cellulose nanofibers (PEDOT:SCNFs) are synthesized through a simple solvent-catalyzed sulfonation process, followed by oxidative self-polymerization and ionic liquid (IL) shielding steps, achieving a low electrochemical impedance of 42 Ω. The physical associations within the composite hydrogel network include complexation, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction, and weak entanglements. These properties confer the hydrogel with high stretchability (770%), superconformability, self-adhesion (28 kPa on pigskin), and self-healing capabilities. By simulating the saltatory propagation effect of the nodes of Ranvier in the nervous system, the biomimetic hydrogel establishes high-fidelity epidermal electronic interfaces, offering benefits such as low interfacial contact impedance, significantly increased SNR (30 dB), as well as large-scale sensor array integration. The advanced biomimetic hydrogel holds tremendous potential for applications in electronic skin (e-skin), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and healthcare assessment devices.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-03-21T05:57:43",
        "content": "In matched observational studies with binary treatments, the Rosenbaum bounds framework is arguably the most widely used sensitivity analysis framework for assessing sensitivity to unobserved covariates. Unlike the binary treatment case, although widely needed in practice, sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies with treatment doses (i.e., non-binary treatments such as ordinal treatments or continuous treatments) still lacks solid foundations and valid methodologies. We fill in this blank by establishing theoretical foundations and novel methodologies under a generalized Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis framework. First, we present a criterion for assessing the validity of sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies with treatment doses and use that criterion to justify the necessity of incorporating the treatment dose information into sensitivity analysis through generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds. We also generalize Rosenbaum's classic sensitivity parameter $\\Gamma$ to the non-binary treatment case and prove its sufficiency. Second, we study the asymptotic properties of sensitivity analysis by generalizing Rosenbaum's classic design sensitivity and Bahadur efficiency for testing Fisher's sharp null to the non-binary treatment case and deriving novel formulas for them. Our theoretical results showed the importance of appropriately incorporating the treatment dose into a test, which is an intrinsic distinction with the binary treatment case. Third, for testing Neyman's weak null (i.e., null sample average treatment effect), we propose the first valid sensitivity analysis procedure for matching with treatment dose through generalizing an existing optimization-based sensitivity analysis for the binary treatment case, built on the generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds and large-scale mixed integer programming.",

        "title": "Deterministic fabrication of graphene hexagonal boron nitride moiré superlattices.",
        "content": "The electronic properties of moiré heterostructures depend sensitively on the relative orientation between layers of the stack. For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a [Formula: see text] ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near-[Formula: see text], not [Formula: see text], relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy of the graphene/hBN moiré on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, nonaligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moiré heterostructures.",

        "content": "The sensitivity analysis of biological system models can significantly contribute to identifying and explaining influences of internal or external changes on model and its elements. We propose here a comprehensive framework to study sensitivity of intra-cellular networks and to identify key intervention pathways, by performing both static and dynamic sensitivity analysis. While the static sensitivity analysis focuses on the impact of network topology and update functions, the dynamic analysis accounts for context-dependent transient state distributions. To study sensitivity, we use discrete models, where each element is represented as a discrete variable and assigned an update rule, which is a function of element's known direct and indirect regulators. Our sensitivity analysis framework allows for assessing the effect of context on individual element sensitivity, as well as on element criticality in reaching preferred outcomes. The framework also enables discovery of most influential pathways in the model that are essential for satisfying important system properties, and thus, could be used for interventions. We discuss the role of nine different network attributes in identifying key elements and intervention pathways, and evaluate their performance using model checking method. Finally, we apply our methods on the model of naive T cell differentiation, and further demonstrate the importance of context-based sensitivity analysis in identifying most influential elements and pathways.",

        "content": "Cow milk (CM) is an important food source for humans, and food allergy caused by CM has attracted attention worldwide. To our knowledge, systematic studies about the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of CM are very rare. In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, and P. pentosaceus fermentation on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability was determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the protein quality, amino acid profile, and color were systematically evaluated. The results showed that these LAB strains exhibited higher protein degradation ability, and the IgE reactivity reduction rate was 41.03%-60.00% and the IgG reduction rate was 29.86%-67.20%, respectively. Additionally, the nutritional value was improved obviously, and the color was altered significantly, which was conductive to develop dairy products. These findings provided a theoretical foundation for the development of hypoallergenic dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus could be considered as good potential candidates for solving cow milk allergy owing to their decreased IgE/IgG binding ability andimproved nutritional and sensory properties, which provide a promising strategy to develop hypoallergenic dairy products.",

Modal parameters of the ambient vibration structures consist of natural frequencies, mode shapes, and modal damping ratios. In this paper, a typical frame with arbitrary loading has been modeled in finite element software, ANSYS, and the responses (accelerations of nodes) have been achieved. By using these data and the codes written in MATLAB, the modal parameters (natural frequencies, mode shapes) of the beams are identified with FDD (Frequency Domain Decomposition) and PP (Peak Picking) methods and then justified with the results of input-output method which was determined by modal analysis. The results indicate that there is a good agreement between three methods for determining the dynamic characteristics of frames.

Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report here a visible-light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls, though a Norrish type II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction with various non-volatile electron-rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocabonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides, as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1-acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer-based mechanism is proposed.",

The second natural frequency is known to be nonlinear in temperature, and this will serve as the main focal point of this work. Cointegration is a method of normalising time series data with respect to one another - often strongly-correlated time series. Cointegration is used in this paper to remove effects from Environmental and Operational Variations, by cointegrating the first four natural frequencies for the Z24 Bridge data. The temperature effects on the natural frequency data are clearly visible within the data, and it is desirable, for the purposes of structural health monitoring, that these effects are removed. The univariate time series are embedded in higher-dimensional space, such that interesting topologies are formed. Topological data analysis is used to analyse the raw time series, and the cointegrated equivalents. A standard topological data analysis pipeline is enacted, where simplicial complexes are constructed from the embedded point clouds. Topological properties are then calculated from the simplicial complexes; such as the persistent homology. The persistent homology is then analysed, to determine the topological structure of all the time series.",

Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices.

We make a brief history of related approaches in the literature, and propose a more general and systematic approach. Nonparametric measures of dependence being well-suited to this approach, we also make a review of available methods and of their use for sensitivity analysis, and clarify some of their properties. As a byproduct, we notably describe a new way of computing correlation ratios for Sobol' indices, which does not require specific experience plans nor rely on independence of the input factors. Finally, we show on synthetic numerical experiments both the interest of target and conditional sensitivity analysis, and the relevance of the dependence measures.",

Apart from volume fraction of nanoparticles, recent experiments have suggested that nanoscale phenomena such as nanoconfinement of grafted chains, altered dynamics and relaxation behavior at the segmental and colloidal scales, and cohesive energy between neighboring coronas are important factors that influence mechanical and rheological properties. How these factors influence the mechanics of thin films subject to micro-ballistic impact remains to be fully understood. Here we examine the micro-ballistic impact resistance of PGN thin films with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grafts using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The grafted chain length and nanoparticle core densities are systematically varied to understand the influences of interparticle spacing, cohesion, and momentum transfer effects under high-velocity impact. Our findings show that the inter-PGN cohesive energy density (",

The model combines the particle dynamics simulator F-TRIDYN, that predicts the helium implantation profile, with the cluster dynamics simulator Xolotl, that predicts the growth and evolution of subsurface helium gas bubbles. In order to keep the sensitivity analysis tractable, we first construct a sparse, high-dimensional polynomial chaos expansion surrogate model for each output quantity of interest, which allows the efficient extraction of sensitivity information. The sensitivity analysis is performed for two problem settings: one for ITER-like conditions, and one that resembles conditions inside the PISCES-A linear plasma device. We present a systematic comparison of important parameters, for both F-TRIDYN and Xolotl in isolation as well as for the coupled model, and discuss the physical interpretation of these results.",

        "content": "In this paper, we aim to perform sensitivity analysis of set-valued models and, in particular, to quantify the impact of uncertain inputs on feasible sets, which are key elements in solving a robust optimization problem under constraints. While most sensitivity analysis methods deal with scalar outputs, this paper introduces a novel approach for performing sensitivity analysis with set-valued outputs. Our innovative methodology is designed for excursion sets, but is versatile enough to be applied to set-valued simulators, including those found in viability fields, or when working with maps like pollutant concentration maps or flood zone maps. We propose to use the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) with a kernel designed for set-valued outputs. After proposing a probabilistic framework for random sets, a first contribution is the proof that this kernel is characteristic, an essential property in a kernel-based sensitivity analysis context. To measure the contribution of each input, we then propose to use HSIC-ANOVA indices. With these indices, we can identify which inputs should be neglected (screening) and we can rank the others according to their influence (ranking). The estimation of these indices is also adapted to the set-valued outputs. Finally, we test the proposed method on three test cases of excursion sets.",

        "content": "Studies in the existing literature propose that allocryptopine possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showcasing its neuroprotective effects by potentially mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aims to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of allocryptopine on various targets and potential mechanisms that have not been previously explored in the literature. Initially, we used MTT and LDH methods to evaluate the effects of allocryptopine on cell viability in BV-2 cells exposed to LPS-induced damage. Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), other inflammatory mediators (Cox-2 and iNOS), and p38 MAPK genes and proteins through qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Also, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on NF-κB proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p-p50, and p-p65) through ELISA assay. Molecular docking analyses were performed to investigate the potential binding of allocryptopine to target proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p50, p65, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, p38, AP-1 (c-Jun and ATF2), IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Cox-2, and iNOS) associated with the TLR4, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK pathways. Our results indicate that allocryptopine exerts a comprehensive influence on pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and modulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. The outcomes of our study suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy of allocryptopine is intricately linked to the modulation of key molecular pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of allocryptopine as a therapeutic agent for addressing neurodegenerative diseases by safeguarding neuronal health.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-05-31T11:08:42",
        "content": "In the analysis of prognosis studies with time-to-event outcomes, dichotomization of patients is often made. As the evaluations of prognostic capacity, the survivals of groups with high/low expression of the biomarker are often estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference between groups is summarized via the hazard ratio (HR). The high/low expressions are usually determined by study-specific cutoff values, which brings heterogeneity over multiple prognosis studies and difficulty to synthesizing the results in a simple way. In meta-analysis of diagnostic studies with binary outcomes, the summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) analysis provides a useful cutoff-free summary over studies. Recently, this methodology has been extended to the time-dependent SROC analysis for time-to-event outcomes in meta-analysis of prognosis studies. In this paper, we propose a sensitivity analysis method for evaluating the impact of publication bias on the time-dependent SROC analysis. Our proposal extends the recently introduced sensitivity analysis method for meta-analysis of diagnostic studies based on the bivariate normal model on sensitivity and specificity pairs. To model the selective publication process specific to prognosis studies, we introduce a trivariate model on the time-dependent sensitivity and specificity and the log-transformed HR. Based on the proved asymptotic property of the trivariate model, we introduce a likelihood based sensitivity analysis method based on the conditional likelihood constrained by the expected proportion of published studies. We illustrate the proposed sensitivity analysis method through the meta-analysis of Ki67 for breast cancer. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.",

As a new type of renewable green energy, biomass carbon has the advantages of low cost and abundant resources. After special treatment, it can be used as an ideal electrode material. Since biomass carbon materials have diverse sources and their morphology is difficult to control, researchers have conducted in-depth research on their preparation process, morphology regulation and application. This review summarizes different biomass carbon structures and their preparation methods and explores the applications of these materials in electrochemical sensors. Modification of biomass carbon materials through pretreatment, physical and chemical activation, heteroatom doping, metal compound composite and other methods can make up for the deficiencies in its pore structure, electrical conductivity and surface wettability, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. The effects of different biomass sources, functional groups, constituent elements and modification methods on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are discussed, and the applications of this type of material in biological molecules, heavy metal ions and pesticide residues are reviewed. Biomass carbon-based materials show great application potential and development prospects in the field of electrochemical sensors.",

Modal parameters of the ambient vibration structures consist of natural frequencies, mode shapes, and modal damping ratios. In this paper, a typical frame with arbitrary loading has been modeled in finite element software, ANSYS, and the responses (accelerations of nodes) have been achieved. By using these data and the codes written in MATLAB, the modal parameters (natural frequencies, mode shapes) of the beams are identified with FDD (Frequency Domain Decomposition) and PP (Peak Picking) methods and then justified with the results of input-output method which was determined by modal analysis. The results indicate that there is a good agreement between three methods for determining the dynamic characteristics of frames. Then, the minimum number of required accelerometer has been determined that recording the acceleration in that location leads to identifying all the natural frequencies of the frame.",

        "content": "Significant advancements in hydrogel-based epidermal electrodes have been made in recent years. However, inherent limitations, such as adaptability, adhesion, and conductivity, have presented challenges, thereby limiting the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stability of the physiological-electrode interface. In this study, we propose the concept of myelin sheath-inspired hydrogel epidermal electronics by incorporating numerous interpenetrating core-sheath-structured conductive nanofibers within a physically cross-linked polyelectrolyte network. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated sulfonated cellulose nanofibers (PEDOT:SCNFs) are synthesized through a simple solvent-catalyzed sulfonation process, followed by oxidative self-polymerization and ionic liquid (IL) shielding steps, achieving a low electrochemical impedance of 42 Ω. The physical associations within the composite hydrogel network include complexation, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction, and weak entanglements. These properties confer the hydrogel with high stretchability (770%), superconformability, self-adhesion (28 kPa on pigskin), and self-healing capabilities. By simulating the saltatory propagation effect of the nodes of Ranvier in the nervous system, the biomimetic hydrogel establishes high-fidelity epidermal electronic interfaces, offering benefits such as low interfacial contact impedance, significantly increased SNR (30 dB), as well as large-scale sensor array integration. The advanced biomimetic hydrogel holds tremendous potential for applications in electronic skin (e-skin), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and healthcare assessment devices.",

        "content": "The paper studies the topological changes from before and after cointegration, for the natural frequencies of the Z24 Bridge. The second natural frequency is known to be nonlinear in temperature, and this will serve as the main focal point of this work. Cointegration is a method of normalising time series data with respect to one another - often strongly-correlated time series. Cointegration is used in this paper to remove effects from Environmental and Operational Variations, by cointegrating the first four natural frequencies for the Z24 Bridge data. The temperature effects on the natural frequency data are clearly visible within the data, and it is desirable, for the purposes of structural health monitoring, that these effects are removed. The univariate time series are embedded in higher-dimensional space, such that interesting topologies are formed. Topological data analysis is used to analyse the raw time series, and the cointegrated equivalents. A standard topological data analysis pipeline is enacted, where simplicial complexes are constructed from the embedded point clouds. Topological properties are then calculated from the simplicial complexes; such as the persistent homology. The persistent homology is then analysed, to determine the topological structure of all the time series.",

        "content": "The electronic properties of moiré heterostructures depend sensitively on the relative orientation between layers of the stack. For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a [Formula: see text] ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near-[Formula: see text], not [Formula: see text], relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy of the graphene/hBN moiré on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, nonaligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moiré heterostructures.",

        "content": "Globally coupled ensembles of phase oscillators serve as useful tools for modeling synchronization and collective behavior in a variety of applications. As interest in the effects of simplicial interactions (i.e., non-additive, higher-order interactions between three or more units) continues to grow we study an extension of the Kuramoto model where oscillators are coupled via three-way interactions that exhibits novel dynamical properties including clustering, multistability, and abrupt desynchronization transitions. Here we provide a rigorous description of the stability of various multicluster states by studying their spectral properties in the thermodynamic limit. Not unlike the classical Kuramoto model, a natural frequency distribution with infinite support yields a population of drifting oscillators, which in turn guarantees that a portion of the spectrum is located on the imaginary axes, resulting in neutrally stable or unstable solutions. On the other hand, a natural frequency distribution with finite support allows for a fully phase-locked state, whose spectrum is real and may be linearly stable or unstable.",

        "content": "Cow milk (CM) is an important food source for humans, and food allergy caused by CM has attracted attention worldwide. To our knowledge, systematic studies about the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of CM are very rare. In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, and P. pentosaceus fermentation on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability was determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the protein quality, amino acid profile, and color were systematically evaluated. The results showed that these LAB strains exhibited higher protein degradation ability, and the IgE reactivity reduction rate was 41.03%-60.00% and the IgG reduction rate was 29.86%-67.20%, respectively. Additionally, the nutritional value was improved obviously, and the color was altered significantly, which was conductive to develop dairy products. These findings provided a theoretical foundation for the development of hypoallergenic dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus could be considered as good potential candidates for solving cow milk allergy owing to their decreased IgE/IgG binding ability andimproved nutritional and sensory properties, which provide a promising strategy to develop hypoallergenic dairy products.",

        "content": "Synchronization of network-coupled dynamical units is important to a variety of natural and engineered processes including circadian rhythms, cardiac function, neural processing, and power grids. Despite this ubiquity, it remains poorly understood how complex network structures and heterogeneous local dynamics combine to either promote or inhibit synchronization. Moreover, for most real-world applications it is impossible to obtain the exact specifications of the system, and there is a lack of theory for how uncertainty affects synchronization. We address this open problem by studying the Synchrony Alignment Function (SAF), which is an objective measure for the synchronization properties of a network of heterogeneous oscillators with given natural frequencies. We extend the SAF framework to analyze network-coupled oscillators with heterogeneous natural frequencies that are drawn as a multivariate random vector. Using probability theory for quadratic forms, we obtain expressions for the expectation and variance of the SAF for given network structures. We conclude with numerical experiments that illustrate how the incorporation of uncertainty yields a more robust theoretical framework for enhancing synchronization, and we provide new perspectives for why synchronization is generically promoted by network properties including degree-frequency correlations, link directedness, and link weight delocalization.",

Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report here a visible-light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls, though a Norrish type II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction with various non-volatile electron-rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocabonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides, as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1-acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer-based mechanism is proposed.",

        "content": "Efficient and accurate numerical algorithms are developed to solve a generalized Kirchhoff-Love plate model subject to three common physical boundary conditions: (i) clamped; (ii) simply supported; and (iii) free. We solve the model equation by discretizing the spatial derivatives using second-order finite-difference schemes, and then advancing the semi-discrete problem in time with either an explicit predictor-corrector or an implicit Newmark-Beta time-stepping algorithm. Stability analysis is conducted for the schemes and the results are used to determine stable time steps in practice. A series of carefully chosen test problems are solved to demonstrate the properties and applications of our numerical approaches. The numerical results confirm the stability and 2nd-order accuracy of the algorithms, and are also comparable with experiments for similar thin plates. As an application, we illustrate a strategy to identify the natural frequencies of a plate using our numerical methods in conjunction with a fast Fourier transformation (FFT) power spectrum analysis of the computed data. Then we take advantage of one of the computed natural frequencies to simulate the interesting physical phenomena known as resonance and beat for a generalized Kirchhoff-Love plate.",

Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices.

Apart from volume fraction of nanoparticles, recent experiments have suggested that nanoscale phenomena such as nanoconfinement of grafted chains, altered dynamics and relaxation behavior at the segmental and colloidal scales, and cohesive energy between neighboring coronas are important factors that influence mechanical and rheological properties. How these factors influence the mechanics of thin films subject to micro-ballistic impact remains to be fully understood. Here we examine the micro-ballistic impact resistance of PGN thin films with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grafts using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The grafted chain length and nanoparticle core densities are systematically varied to understand the influences of interparticle spacing, cohesion, and momentum transfer effects under high-velocity impact.

The complex structure of the soft actuator is simplified by approximating it as a cantilever beam. This allows us to derive approximated nonlinear kinematic models and a dynamical model, which is explored to understand the correlation between natural frequency and dimensional parameters of SPA. The design problem is then transformed into an optimization problem, using kinematic equations as the objective function and the dynamical equation as a constraint. By solving this optimization problem, the optimal dimensional parameters are determined. Six prototypes are manufactured to validate the proposed approach. The optimal actuator successfully generates the desired force/torque and bending angle, while its natural frequency remains within the constrained range. This work highlights the potential of using optimization formulation and approximated nonlinear models to boost the performance and dynamical properties of soft pneumatic actuators.",

        "content": "Studies in the existing literature propose that allocryptopine possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showcasing its neuroprotective effects by potentially mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aims to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of allocryptopine on various targets and potential mechanisms that have not been previously explored in the literature. Initially, we used MTT and LDH methods to evaluate the effects of allocryptopine on cell viability in BV-2 cells exposed to LPS-induced damage. Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), other inflammatory mediators (Cox-2 and iNOS), and p38 MAPK genes and proteins through qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Also, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on NF-κB proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p-p50, and p-p65) through ELISA assay. Molecular docking analyses were performed to investigate the potential binding of allocryptopine to target proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p50, p65, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, p38, AP-1 (c-Jun and ATF2), IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Cox-2, and iNOS) associated with the TLR4, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK pathways. Our results indicate that allocryptopine exerts a comprehensive influence on pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and modulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. The outcomes of our study suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy of allocryptopine is intricately linked to the modulation of key molecular pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of allocryptopine as a therapeutic agent for addressing neurodegenerative diseases by safeguarding neuronal health.",

        "title": "A new perspective on Bayesian Operational Modal Analysis",
        "publishedDate": "2024-08-16T11:11:56",
        "content": "In the field of operational modal analysis (OMA), obtained modal information is frequently used to assess the current state of aerospace, mechanical, offshore and civil structures. However, the stochasticity of operational systems and the lack of forcing information can lead to inconsistent results. Quantifying the uncertainty of the recovered modal parameters through OMA is therefore of significant value. In this article, a new perspective on Bayesian OMA is proposed: a Bayesian stochastic subspace identification (SSI) algorithm. Distinct from existing approaches to Bayesian OMA, a hierarchical probabilistic model is embedded at the core of covariance-driven SSI. Through substitution of canonical correlation analysis with a Bayesian equivalent, posterior distributions over the modal properties are obtained. Two inference schemes are presented for the proposed Bayesian formulation: Markov Chain Monte Carlo and variational Bayes. Two case studies are then explored. The first is benchmark study using data from a simulated, multi degree-of-freedom, linear system. Following application of Bayesian SSI, it is shown that the same posterior is targeted and recovered by both inference schemes, with good agreement between the posterior mean and the conventional SSI result. The second study applies the variational form to data obtained from an in-service structure: The Z24 bridge. The results of this study are presented at single model orders, and then using a stabilisation diagram. The recovered posterior uncertainty is presented and compared to the classic SSI result. It is observed that the posterior distributions with mean values coinciding with the natural frequencies exhibit lower variance than values situated away from the natural frequencies.",

        "content": "Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is one of the most widely explored additive manufacturing method that uses thermoplastic materials to manufacture products. Mechanical properties of parts manufactured using FDM are influenced by different process parameters involved during manufacturing as they impact the bonding among different layers of cross-section. In this study, the effect of infill patterns and build orientations on the mechanical properties of PLA based parts manufactured using FDM method is studied. Six different infill patterns (triangles, cubic, concentric, tetrahedral, lines, and zigzag) and three different orientations (flatwise, edgewise, and upright) are considered for rectangular beam type parts. For determining mechanical properties of parts with different infill patterns and orientations, flexural bending test is performed. Experimental modal analysis of manufactured parts is performed to observe the relation of natural frequencies with elastic modulus of the parts obtained from flexural bending test. The possibility of experimental modal analysis as an alternative non-destructive method for testing mechanical properties of FDM 3D printed parts is explored.",

        "content": "In recent years, biomass carbon materials have received widespread attention in the field of electrochemical sensors. As a new type of renewable green energy, biomass carbon has the advantages of low cost and abundant resources. After special treatment, it can be used as an ideal electrode material. Since biomass carbon materials have diverse sources and their morphology is difficult to control, researchers have conducted in-depth research on their preparation process, morphology regulation and application. This review summarizes different biomass carbon structures and their preparation methods and explores the applications of these materials in electrochemical sensors. Modification of biomass carbon materials through pretreatment, physical and chemical activation, heteroatom doping, metal compound composite and other methods can make up for the deficiencies in its pore structure, electrical conductivity and surface wettability, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. The effects of different biomass sources, functional groups, constituent elements and modification methods on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are discussed, and the applications of this type of material in biological molecules, heavy metal ions and pesticide residues are reviewed. Biomass carbon-based materials show great application potential and development prospects in the field of electrochemical sensors.",

        "content": "Significant advancements in hydrogel-based epidermal electrodes have been made in recent years. However, inherent limitations, such as adaptability, adhesion, and conductivity, have presented challenges, thereby limiting the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stability of the physiological-electrode interface. In this study, we propose the concept of myelin sheath-inspired hydrogel epidermal electronics by incorporating numerous interpenetrating core-sheath-structured conductive nanofibers within a physically cross-linked polyelectrolyte network. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated sulfonated cellulose nanofibers (PEDOT:SCNFs) are synthesized through a simple solvent-catalyzed sulfonation process, followed by oxidative self-polymerization and ionic liquid (IL) shielding steps, achieving a low electrochemical impedance of 42 Ω. The physical associations within the composite hydrogel network include complexation, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction, and weak entanglements. These properties confer the hydrogel with high stretchability (770%), superconformability, self-adhesion (28 kPa on pigskin), and self-healing capabilities. By simulating the saltatory propagation effect of the nodes of Ranvier in the nervous system, the biomimetic hydrogel establishes high-fidelity epidermal electronic interfaces, offering benefits such as low interfacial contact impedance, significantly increased SNR (30 dB), as well as large-scale sensor array integration. The advanced biomimetic hydrogel holds tremendous potential for applications in electronic skin (e-skin), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and healthcare assessment devices.",

        "content": "The electronic properties of moiré heterostructures depend sensitively on the relative orientation between layers of the stack. For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a [Formula: see text] ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near-[Formula: see text], not [Formula: see text], relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy of the graphene/hBN moiré on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, nonaligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moiré heterostructures.",

        "content": "Cow milk (CM) is an important food source for humans, and food allergy caused by CM has attracted attention worldwide. To our knowledge, systematic studies about the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of CM are very rare. In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, and P. pentosaceus fermentation on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability was determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the protein quality, amino acid profile, and color were systematically evaluated. The results showed that these LAB strains exhibited higher protein degradation ability, and the IgE reactivity reduction rate was 41.03%-60.00% and the IgG reduction rate was 29.86%-67.20%, respectively. Additionally, the nutritional value was improved obviously, and the color was altered significantly, which was conductive to develop dairy products. These findings provided a theoretical foundation for the development of hypoallergenic dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus could be considered as good potential candidates for solving cow milk allergy owing to their decreased IgE/IgG binding ability andimproved nutritional and sensory properties, which provide a promising strategy to develop hypoallergenic dairy products.",

Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report here a visible-light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls, though a Norrish type II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction with various non-volatile electron-rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocabonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides, as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1-acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer-based mechanism is proposed.",

Their peculiar molecular properties stem from a strong and intimate overlap between the metal centered d orbitals and the p system of the acetylide ligands, resulting in plethora of fascinating properties such as strong and tunable visible light absorption with a strong MLCT character essential for sensing, photovoltaics, light-harvesting applications or non-linear optical properties. Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices. Altogether, we show in this review the potential of RuII acetylide compounds, insisting on the molecular design and suggesting further research developments for this class of organometallic dyes, including supramolecular chemistry.",

Apart from volume fraction of nanoparticles, recent experiments have suggested that nanoscale phenomena such as nanoconfinement of grafted chains, altered dynamics and relaxation behavior at the segmental and colloidal scales, and cohesive energy between neighboring coronas are important factors that influence mechanical and rheological properties. How these factors influence the mechanics of thin films subject to micro-ballistic impact remains to be fully understood. Here we examine the micro-ballistic impact resistance of PGN thin films with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grafts using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The grafted chain length and nanoparticle core densities are systematically varied to understand the influences of interparticle spacing, cohesion, and momentum transfer effects under high-velocity impact.

        "title": "Allocryptopine Attenuates Inflammatory Responses in Microglial Cells Via TLR4-Dependent NF-κB and p38 MAPK Pathways.",
        "content": "Studies in the existing literature propose that allocryptopine possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showcasing its neuroprotective effects by potentially mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aims to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of allocryptopine on various targets and potential mechanisms that have not been previously explored in the literature. Initially, we used MTT and LDH methods to evaluate the effects of allocryptopine on cell viability in BV-2 cells exposed to LPS-induced damage. Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), other inflammatory mediators (Cox-2 and iNOS), and p38 MAPK genes and proteins through qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Also, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on NF-κB proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p-p50, and p-p65) through ELISA assay. Molecular docking analyses were performed to investigate the potential binding of allocryptopine to target proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p50, p65, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, p38, AP-1 (c-Jun and ATF2), IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Cox-2, and iNOS) associated with the TLR4, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK pathways. Our results indicate that allocryptopine exerts a comprehensive influence on pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and modulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. The outcomes of our study suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy of allocryptopine is intricately linked to the modulation of key molecular pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of allocryptopine as a therapeutic agent for addressing neurodegenerative diseases by safeguarding neuronal health.",

        "content": "In recent years, biomass carbon materials have received widespread attention in the field of electrochemical sensors. As a new type of renewable green energy, biomass carbon has the advantages of low cost and abundant resources. After special treatment, it can be used as an ideal electrode material. Since biomass carbon materials have diverse sources and their morphology is difficult to control, researchers have conducted in-depth research on their preparation process, morphology regulation and application. This review summarizes different biomass carbon structures and their preparation methods and explores the applications of these materials in electrochemical sensors. Modification of biomass carbon materials through pretreatment, physical and chemical activation, heteroatom doping, metal compound composite and other methods can make up for the deficiencies in its pore structure, electrical conductivity and surface wettability, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. The effects of different biomass sources, functional groups, constituent elements and modification methods on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are discussed, and the applications of this type of material in biological molecules, heavy metal ions and pesticide residues are reviewed. Biomass carbon-based materials show great application potential and development prospects in the field of electrochemical sensors.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-09-12T16:36:22",
        "content": "In matched observational studies, the inferred causal conclusions pretending that matching has taken into account all confounding can be sensitive to unmeasured confounding. In such cases, a sensitivity analysis is often conducted, which investigates whether the observed association between treatment and outcome is due to effects caused by the treatment or it is due to hidden confounding. In general, a sensitivity analysis tries to infer the minimum amount of hidden biases needed in order to explain away the observed association between treatment and outcome, assuming that the treatment has no effect. If the needed bias is large, then the treatment is likely to have significant effects. The Rosenbaum sensitivity analysis is a modern approach for conducting sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies. It investigates what magnitude the maximum of the hidden biases from all matched sets needs to be in order to explain away the observed association, assuming that the treatment has no effect. However, such a sensitivity analysis can be overly conservative and pessimistic, especially when the investigators believe that some matched sets may have exceptionally large hidden biases. In this paper, we generalize Rosenbaum's framework to conduct sensitivity analysis on quantiles of hidden biases from all matched sets, which are more robust than the maximum. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis on all quantiles of hidden biases is simultaneously valid and is thus a free lunch added to the conventional sensitivity analysis. The proposed approach works for general outcomes, general matched studies and general test statistics. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis also works for bounded null hypotheses as long as the test statistic satisfies certain properties. An R package implementing the proposed method is also available online.",

        "content": "Significant advancements in hydrogel-based epidermal electrodes have been made in recent years. However, inherent limitations, such as adaptability, adhesion, and conductivity, have presented challenges, thereby limiting the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stability of the physiological-electrode interface. In this study, we propose the concept of myelin sheath-inspired hydrogel epidermal electronics by incorporating numerous interpenetrating core-sheath-structured conductive nanofibers within a physically cross-linked polyelectrolyte network. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated sulfonated cellulose nanofibers (PEDOT:SCNFs) are synthesized through a simple solvent-catalyzed sulfonation process, followed by oxidative self-polymerization and ionic liquid (IL) shielding steps, achieving a low electrochemical impedance of 42 Ω. The physical associations within the composite hydrogel network include complexation, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction, and weak entanglements. These properties confer the hydrogel with high stretchability (770%), superconformability, self-adhesion (28 kPa on pigskin), and self-healing capabilities. By simulating the saltatory propagation effect of the nodes of Ranvier in the nervous system, the biomimetic hydrogel establishes high-fidelity epidermal electronic interfaces, offering benefits such as low interfacial contact impedance, significantly increased SNR (30 dB), as well as large-scale sensor array integration. The advanced biomimetic hydrogel holds tremendous potential for applications in electronic skin (e-skin), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and healthcare assessment devices.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-03-21T05:57:43",
        "content": "In matched observational studies with binary treatments, the Rosenbaum bounds framework is arguably the most widely used sensitivity analysis framework for assessing sensitivity to unobserved covariates. Unlike the binary treatment case, although widely needed in practice, sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies with treatment doses (i.e., non-binary treatments such as ordinal treatments or continuous treatments) still lacks solid foundations and valid methodologies. We fill in this blank by establishing theoretical foundations and novel methodologies under a generalized Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis framework. First, we present a criterion for assessing the validity of sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies with treatment doses and use that criterion to justify the necessity of incorporating the treatment dose information into sensitivity analysis through generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds. We also generalize Rosenbaum's classic sensitivity parameter $\\Gamma$ to the non-binary treatment case and prove its sufficiency. Second, we study the asymptotic properties of sensitivity analysis by generalizing Rosenbaum's classic design sensitivity and Bahadur efficiency for testing Fisher's sharp null to the non-binary treatment case and deriving novel formulas for them. Our theoretical results showed the importance of appropriately incorporating the treatment dose into a test, which is an intrinsic distinction with the binary treatment case. Third, for testing Neyman's weak null (i.e., null sample average treatment effect), we propose the first valid sensitivity analysis procedure for matching with treatment dose through generalizing an existing optimization-based sensitivity analysis for the binary treatment case, built on the generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds and large-scale mixed integer programming.",

        "content": "The electronic properties of moiré heterostructures depend sensitively on the relative orientation between layers of the stack. For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a [Formula: see text] ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near-[Formula: see text], not [Formula: see text], relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy of the graphene/hBN moiré on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, nonaligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moiré heterostructures.",

        "content": "The sensitivity analysis of biological system models can significantly contribute to identifying and explaining influences of internal or external changes on model and its elements. We propose here a comprehensive framework to study sensitivity of intra-cellular networks and to identify key intervention pathways, by performing both static and dynamic sensitivity analysis. While the static sensitivity analysis focuses on the impact of network topology and update functions, the dynamic analysis accounts for context-dependent transient state distributions. To study sensitivity, we use discrete models, where each element is represented as a discrete variable and assigned an update rule, which is a function of element's known direct and indirect regulators. Our sensitivity analysis framework allows for assessing the effect of context on individual element sensitivity, as well as on element criticality in reaching preferred outcomes. The framework also enables discovery of most influential pathways in the model that are essential for satisfying important system properties, and thus, could be used for interventions. We discuss the role of nine different network attributes in identifying key elements and intervention pathways, and evaluate their performance using model checking method. Finally, we apply our methods on the model of naive T cell differentiation, and further demonstrate the importance of context-based sensitivity analysis in identifying most influential elements and pathways.",

        "content": "Cow milk (CM) is an important food source for humans, and food allergy caused by CM has attracted attention worldwide. To our knowledge, systematic studies about the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of CM are very rare. In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, and P. pentosaceus fermentation on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability was determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the protein quality, amino acid profile, and color were systematically evaluated. The results showed that these LAB strains exhibited higher protein degradation ability, and the IgE reactivity reduction rate was 41.03%-60.00% and the IgG reduction rate was 29.86%-67.20%, respectively. Additionally, the nutritional value was improved obviously, and the color was altered significantly, which was conductive to develop dairy products. These findings provided a theoretical foundation for the development of hypoallergenic dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus could be considered as good potential candidates for solving cow milk allergy owing to their decreased IgE/IgG binding ability andimproved nutritional and sensory properties, which provide a promising strategy to develop hypoallergenic dairy products.",

In this paper, a typical frame with arbitrary loading has been modeled in finite element software, ANSYS, and the responses (accelerations of nodes) have been achieved. By using these data and the codes written in MATLAB, the modal parameters (natural frequencies, mode shapes) of the beams are identified with FDD (Frequency Domain Decomposition) and PP (Peak Picking) methods and then justified with the results of input-output method which was determined by modal analysis. The results indicate that there is a good agreement between three methods for determining the dynamic characteristics of frames.

Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report here a visible-light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls, though a Norrish type II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction with various non-volatile electron-rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocabonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides, as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1-acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer-based mechanism is proposed.",

        "content": "The paper studies the topological changes from before and after cointegration, for the natural frequencies of the Z24 Bridge. The second natural frequency is known to be nonlinear in temperature, and this will serve as the main focal point of this work. Cointegration is a method of normalising time series data with respect to one another - often strongly-correlated time series. Cointegration is used in this paper to remove effects from Environmental and Operational Variations, by cointegrating the first four natural frequencies for the Z24 Bridge data. The temperature effects on the natural frequency data are clearly visible within the data, and it is desirable, for the purposes of structural health monitoring, that these effects are removed. The univariate time series are embedded in higher-dimensional space, such that interesting topologies are formed. Topological data analysis is used to analyse the raw time series, and the cointegrated equivalents. A standard topological data analysis pipeline is enacted, where simplicial complexes are constructed from the embedded point clouds. Topological properties are then calculated from the simplicial complexes; such as the persistent homology. The persistent homology is then analysed, to determine the topological structure of all the time series.",

        "content": "In this contribution, we describe the various research domains in which RuII alkynyl derivatives are involved. Their peculiar molecular properties stem from a strong and intimate overlap between the metal centered d orbitals and the p system of the acetylide ligands, resulting in plethora of fascinating properties such as strong and tunable visible light absorption with a strong MLCT character essential for sensing, photovoltaics, light-harvesting applications or non-linear optical properties. Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices. Altogether, we show in this review the potential of RuII acetylide compounds, insisting on the molecular design and suggesting further research developments for this class of organometallic dyes, including supramolecular chemistry.",

Apart from volume fraction of nanoparticles, recent experiments have suggested that nanoscale phenomena such as nanoconfinement of grafted chains, altered dynamics and relaxation behavior at the segmental and colloidal scales, and cohesive energy between neighboring coronas are important factors that influence mechanical and rheological properties. How these factors influence the mechanics of thin films subject to micro-ballistic impact remains to be fully understood. Here we examine the micro-ballistic impact resistance of PGN thin films with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grafts using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The grafted chain length and nanoparticle core densities are systematically varied to understand the influences of interparticle spacing, cohesion, and momentum transfer effects under high-velocity impact. Our findings show that the inter-PGN cohesive energy density (",

The model combines the particle dynamics simulator F-TRIDYN, that predicts the helium implantation profile, with the cluster dynamics simulator Xolotl, that predicts the growth and evolution of subsurface helium gas bubbles. In order to keep the sensitivity analysis tractable, we first construct a sparse, high-dimensional polynomial chaos expansion surrogate model for each output quantity of interest, which allows the efficient extraction of sensitivity information. The sensitivity analysis is performed for two problem settings: one for ITER-like conditions, and one that resembles conditions inside the PISCES-A linear plasma device. We present a systematic comparison of important parameters, for both F-TRIDYN and Xolotl in isolation as well as for the coupled model, and discuss the physical interpretation of these results.",

        "content": "In this paper, we aim to perform sensitivity analysis of set-valued models and, in particular, to quantify the impact of uncertain inputs on feasible sets, which are key elements in solving a robust optimization problem under constraints. While most sensitivity analysis methods deal with scalar outputs, this paper introduces a novel approach for performing sensitivity analysis with set-valued outputs. Our innovative methodology is designed for excursion sets, but is versatile enough to be applied to set-valued simulators, including those found in viability fields, or when working with maps like pollutant concentration maps or flood zone maps. We propose to use the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) with a kernel designed for set-valued outputs. After proposing a probabilistic framework for random sets, a first contribution is the proof that this kernel is characteristic, an essential property in a kernel-based sensitivity analysis context. To measure the contribution of each input, we then propose to use HSIC-ANOVA indices. With these indices, we can identify which inputs should be neglected (screening) and we can rank the others according to their influence (ranking). The estimation of these indices is also adapted to the set-valued outputs. Finally, we test the proposed method on three test cases of excursion sets.",

        "content": "Studies in the existing literature propose that allocryptopine possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showcasing its neuroprotective effects by potentially mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aims to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of allocryptopine on various targets and potential mechanisms that have not been previously explored in the literature. Initially, we used MTT and LDH methods to evaluate the effects of allocryptopine on cell viability in BV-2 cells exposed to LPS-induced damage. Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), other inflammatory mediators (Cox-2 and iNOS), and p38 MAPK genes and proteins through qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Also, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on NF-κB proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p-p50, and p-p65) through ELISA assay. Molecular docking analyses were performed to investigate the potential binding of allocryptopine to target proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p50, p65, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, p38, AP-1 (c-Jun and ATF2), IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Cox-2, and iNOS) associated with the TLR4, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK pathways. Our results indicate that allocryptopine exerts a comprehensive influence on pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and modulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. The outcomes of our study suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy of allocryptopine is intricately linked to the modulation of key molecular pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of allocryptopine as a therapeutic agent for addressing neurodegenerative diseases by safeguarding neuronal health.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-05-31T11:08:42",
        "content": "In the analysis of prognosis studies with time-to-event outcomes, dichotomization of patients is often made. As the evaluations of prognostic capacity, the survivals of groups with high/low expression of the biomarker are often estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference between groups is summarized via the hazard ratio (HR). The high/low expressions are usually determined by study-specific cutoff values, which brings heterogeneity over multiple prognosis studies and difficulty to synthesizing the results in a simple way. In meta-analysis of diagnostic studies with binary outcomes, the summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) analysis provides a useful cutoff-free summary over studies. Recently, this methodology has been extended to the time-dependent SROC analysis for time-to-event outcomes in meta-analysis of prognosis studies. In this paper, we propose a sensitivity analysis method for evaluating the impact of publication bias on the time-dependent SROC analysis. Our proposal extends the recently introduced sensitivity analysis method for meta-analysis of diagnostic studies based on the bivariate normal model on sensitivity and specificity pairs. To model the selective publication process specific to prognosis studies, we introduce a trivariate model on the time-dependent sensitivity and specificity and the log-transformed HR. Based on the proved asymptotic property of the trivariate model, we introduce a likelihood based sensitivity analysis method based on the conditional likelihood constrained by the expected proportion of published studies. We illustrate the proposed sensitivity analysis method through the meta-analysis of Ki67 for breast cancer. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.",

        "content": "In recent years, biomass carbon materials have received widespread attention in the field of electrochemical sensors. As a new type of renewable green energy, biomass carbon has the advantages of low cost and abundant resources. After special treatment, it can be used as an ideal electrode material. Since biomass carbon materials have diverse sources and their morphology is difficult to control, researchers have conducted in-depth research on their preparation process, morphology regulation and application. This review summarizes different biomass carbon structures and their preparation methods and explores the applications of these materials in electrochemical sensors. Modification of biomass carbon materials through pretreatment, physical and chemical activation, heteroatom doping, metal compound composite and other methods can make up for the deficiencies in its pore structure, electrical conductivity and surface wettability, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. The effects of different biomass sources, functional groups, constituent elements and modification methods on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are discussed, and the applications of this type of material in biological molecules, heavy metal ions and pesticide residues are reviewed. Biomass carbon-based materials show great application potential and development prospects in the field of electrochemical sensors.",

        "title": "Sensitivity Analysis for Quantiles of Hidden Biases in Matched Observational Studies",
        "publishedDate": "2023-09-12T16:36:22",
        "content": "In matched observational studies, the inferred causal conclusions pretending that matching has taken into account all confounding can be sensitive to unmeasured confounding. In such cases, a sensitivity analysis is often conducted, which investigates whether the observed association between treatment and outcome is due to effects caused by the treatment or it is due to hidden confounding. In general, a sensitivity analysis tries to infer the minimum amount of hidden biases needed in order to explain away the observed association between treatment and outcome, assuming that the treatment has no effect. If the needed bias is large, then the treatment is likely to have significant effects. The Rosenbaum sensitivity analysis is a modern approach for conducting sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies. It investigates what magnitude the maximum of the hidden biases from all matched sets needs to be in order to explain away the observed association, assuming that the treatment has no effect. However, such a sensitivity analysis can be overly conservative and pessimistic, especially when the investigators believe that some matched sets may have exceptionally large hidden biases. In this paper, we generalize Rosenbaum's framework to conduct sensitivity analysis on quantiles of hidden biases from all matched sets, which are more robust than the maximum. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis on all quantiles of hidden biases is simultaneously valid and is thus a free lunch added to the conventional sensitivity analysis. The proposed approach works for general outcomes, general matched studies and general test statistics. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed sensitivity analysis also works for bounded null hypotheses as long as the test statistic satisfies certain properties. An R package implementing the proposed method is also available online.",

        "content": "Significant advancements in hydrogel-based epidermal electrodes have been made in recent years. However, inherent limitations, such as adaptability, adhesion, and conductivity, have presented challenges, thereby limiting the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stability of the physiological-electrode interface. In this study, we propose the concept of myelin sheath-inspired hydrogel epidermal electronics by incorporating numerous interpenetrating core-sheath-structured conductive nanofibers within a physically cross-linked polyelectrolyte network. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated sulfonated cellulose nanofibers (PEDOT:SCNFs) are synthesized through a simple solvent-catalyzed sulfonation process, followed by oxidative self-polymerization and ionic liquid (IL) shielding steps, achieving a low electrochemical impedance of 42 Ω. The physical associations within the composite hydrogel network include complexation, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction, and weak entanglements. These properties confer the hydrogel with high stretchability (770%), superconformability, self-adhesion (28 kPa on pigskin), and self-healing capabilities. By simulating the saltatory propagation effect of the nodes of Ranvier in the nervous system, the biomimetic hydrogel establishes high-fidelity epidermal electronic interfaces, offering benefits such as low interfacial contact impedance, significantly increased SNR (30 dB), as well as large-scale sensor array integration. The advanced biomimetic hydrogel holds tremendous potential for applications in electronic skin (e-skin), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and healthcare assessment devices.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-03-21T05:57:43",
        "content": "In matched observational studies with binary treatments, the Rosenbaum bounds framework is arguably the most widely used sensitivity analysis framework for assessing sensitivity to unobserved covariates. Unlike the binary treatment case, although widely needed in practice, sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies with treatment doses (i.e., non-binary treatments such as ordinal treatments or continuous treatments) still lacks solid foundations and valid methodologies. We fill in this blank by establishing theoretical foundations and novel methodologies under a generalized Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis framework. First, we present a criterion for assessing the validity of sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies with treatment doses and use that criterion to justify the necessity of incorporating the treatment dose information into sensitivity analysis through generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds. We also generalize Rosenbaum's classic sensitivity parameter $\\Gamma$ to the non-binary treatment case and prove its sufficiency. Second, we study the asymptotic properties of sensitivity analysis by generalizing Rosenbaum's classic design sensitivity and Bahadur efficiency for testing Fisher's sharp null to the non-binary treatment case and deriving novel formulas for them. Our theoretical results showed the importance of appropriately incorporating the treatment dose into a test, which is an intrinsic distinction with the binary treatment case. Third, for testing Neyman's weak null (i.e., null sample average treatment effect), we propose the first valid sensitivity analysis procedure for matching with treatment dose through generalizing an existing optimization-based sensitivity analysis for the binary treatment case, built on the generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds and large-scale mixed integer programming.",

        "title": "Deterministic fabrication of graphene hexagonal boron nitride moiré superlattices.",
        "content": "The electronic properties of moiré heterostructures depend sensitively on the relative orientation between layers of the stack. For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a [Formula: see text] ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near-[Formula: see text], not [Formula: see text], relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy of the graphene/hBN moiré on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, nonaligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moiré heterostructures.",

        "publishedDate": "2019-02-08T18:27:24",
        "content": "The sensitivity analysis of biological system models can significantly contribute to identifying and explaining influences of internal or external changes on model and its elements. We propose here a comprehensive framework to study sensitivity of intra-cellular networks and to identify key intervention pathways, by performing both static and dynamic sensitivity analysis. While the static sensitivity analysis focuses on the impact of network topology and update functions, the dynamic analysis accounts for context-dependent transient state distributions. To study sensitivity, we use discrete models, where each element is represented as a discrete variable and assigned an update rule, which is a function of element's known direct and indirect regulators. Our sensitivity analysis framework allows for assessing the effect of context on individual element sensitivity, as well as on element criticality in reaching preferred outcomes. The framework also enables discovery of most influential pathways in the model that are essential for satisfying important system properties, and thus, could be used for interventions. We discuss the role of nine different network attributes in identifying key elements and intervention pathways, and evaluate their performance using model checking method. Finally, we apply our methods on the model of naive T cell differentiation, and further demonstrate the importance of context-based sensitivity analysis in identifying most influential elements and pathways.",

        "content": "Cow milk (CM) is an important food source for humans, and food allergy caused by CM has attracted attention worldwide. To our knowledge, systematic studies about the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability and nutritional properties of CM are very rare. In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, and P. pentosaceus fermentation on the IgE-/IgG-binding ability was determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and the protein quality, amino acid profile, and color were systematically evaluated. The results showed that these LAB strains exhibited higher protein degradation ability, and the IgE reactivity reduction rate was 41.03%-60.00% and the IgG reduction rate was 29.86%-67.20%, respectively. Additionally, the nutritional value was improved obviously, and the color was altered significantly, which was conductive to develop dairy products. These findings provided a theoretical foundation for the development of hypoallergenic dairy products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus could be considered as good potential candidates for solving cow milk allergy owing to their decreased IgE/IgG binding ability andimproved nutritional and sensory properties, which provide a promising strategy to develop hypoallergenic dairy products.",

        "content": "Operational modal analysis (OMA) aims at identifying the modal properties of a structure based on response data of the structure excited by ambient sources. Modal parameters of the ambient vibration structures consist of natural frequencies, mode shapes, and modal damping ratios. In this paper, a typical frame with arbitrary loading has been modeled in finite element software, ANSYS, and the responses (accelerations of nodes) have been achieved. By using these data and the codes written in MATLAB, the modal parameters (natural frequencies, mode shapes) of the beams are identified with FDD (Frequency Domain Decomposition) and PP (Peak Picking) methods and then justified with the results of input-output method which was determined by modal analysis. The results indicate that there is a good agreement between three methods for determining the dynamic characteristics of frames. Then, the minimum number of required accelerometer has been determined that recording the acceleration in that location leads to identifying all the natural frequencies of the frame.",

Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report here a visible-light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls, though a Norrish type II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction with various non-volatile electron-rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocabonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides, as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1-acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia-Paternò-Büchi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer-based mechanism is proposed.",

The second natural frequency is known to be nonlinear in temperature, and this will serve as the main focal point of this work. Cointegration is a method of normalising time series data with respect to one another - often strongly-correlated time series. Cointegration is used in this paper to remove effects from Environmental and Operational Variations, by cointegrating the first four natural frequencies for the Z24 Bridge data. The temperature effects on the natural frequency data are clearly visible within the data, and it is desirable, for the purposes of structural health monitoring, that these effects are removed. The univariate time series are embedded in higher-dimensional space, such that interesting topologies are formed. Topological data analysis is used to analyse the raw time series, and the cointegrated equivalents. A standard topological data analysis pipeline is enacted, where simplicial complexes are constructed from the embedded point clouds. Topological properties are then calculated from the simplicial complexes; such as the persistent homology. The persistent homology is then analysed, to determine the topological structure of all the time series.",

Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices.

As a byproduct, we notably describe a new way of computing correlation ratios for Sobol' indices, which does not require specific experience plans nor rely on independence of the input factors.

        "content": "Self-assembled polymer grafted nanoparticles (PGNs) are of great interest for their potential to enhance mechanical properties compared to neat polymers and nanocomposites. Apart from volume fraction of nanoparticles, recent experiments have suggested that nanoscale phenomena such as nanoconfinement of grafted chains, altered dynamics and relaxation behavior at the segmental and colloidal scales, and cohesive energy between neighboring coronas are important factors that influence mechanical and rheological properties. How these factors influence the mechanics of thin films subject to micro-ballistic impact remains to be fully understood. Here we examine the micro-ballistic impact resistance of PGN thin films with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grafts using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The grafted chain length and nanoparticle core densities are systematically varied to understand the influences of interparticle spacing, cohesion, and momentum transfer effects under high-velocity impact. Our findings show that the inter-PGN cohesive energy density (",

        "content": "We construct a global sensitivity analysis framework for a coupled multiphysics model used to predict the changes in material properties and surface morphology of helium plasma-facing components in future fusion reactors. The model combines the particle dynamics simulator F-TRIDYN, that predicts the helium implantation profile, with the cluster dynamics simulator Xolotl, that predicts the growth and evolution of subsurface helium gas bubbles. In order to keep the sensitivity analysis tractable, we first construct a sparse, high-dimensional polynomial chaos expansion surrogate model for each output quantity of interest, which allows the efficient extraction of sensitivity information. The sensitivity analysis is performed for two problem settings: one for ITER-like conditions, and one that resembles conditions inside the PISCES-A linear plasma device. We present a systematic comparison of important parameters, for both F-TRIDYN and Xolotl in isolation as well as for the coupled model, and discuss the physical interpretation of these results.",

        "content": "In this paper, we aim to perform sensitivity analysis of set-valued models and, in particular, to quantify the impact of uncertain inputs on feasible sets, which are key elements in solving a robust optimization problem under constraints. While most sensitivity analysis methods deal with scalar outputs, this paper introduces a novel approach for performing sensitivity analysis with set-valued outputs. Our innovative methodology is designed for excursion sets, but is versatile enough to be applied to set-valued simulators, including those found in viability fields, or when working with maps like pollutant concentration maps or flood zone maps. We propose to use the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) with a kernel designed for set-valued outputs. After proposing a probabilistic framework for random sets, a first contribution is the proof that this kernel is characteristic, an essential property in a kernel-based sensitivity analysis context. To measure the contribution of each input, we then propose to use HSIC-ANOVA indices. With these indices, we can identify which inputs should be neglected (screening) and we can rank the others according to their influence (ranking). The estimation of these indices is also adapted to the set-valued outputs. Finally, we test the proposed method on three test cases of excursion sets.",

        "content": "Studies in the existing literature propose that allocryptopine possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showcasing its neuroprotective effects by potentially mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aims to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of allocryptopine on various targets and potential mechanisms that have not been previously explored in the literature. Initially, we used MTT and LDH methods to evaluate the effects of allocryptopine on cell viability in BV-2 cells exposed to LPS-induced damage. Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), other inflammatory mediators (Cox-2 and iNOS), and p38 MAPK genes and proteins through qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Also, we evaluated the impact of allocryptopine on NF-κB proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p-p50, and p-p65) through ELISA assay. Molecular docking analyses were performed to investigate the potential binding of allocryptopine to target proteins (TLR4, MyD88, IκBα, p50, p65, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, p38, AP-1 (c-Jun and ATF2), IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Cox-2, and iNOS) associated with the TLR4, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK pathways. Our results indicate that allocryptopine exerts a comprehensive influence on pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and modulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. The outcomes of our study suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy of allocryptopine is intricately linked to the modulation of key molecular pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings highlight the potential of allocryptopine as a therapeutic agent for addressing neurodegenerative diseases by safeguarding neuronal health.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-05-31T11:08:42",
        "content": "In the analysis of prognosis studies with time-to-event outcomes, dichotomization of patients is often made. As the evaluations of prognostic capacity, the survivals of groups with high/low expression of the biomarker are often estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference between groups is summarized via the hazard ratio (HR). The high/low expressions are usually determined by study-specific cutoff values, which brings heterogeneity over multiple prognosis studies and difficulty to synthesizing the results in a simple way. In meta-analysis of diagnostic studies with binary outcomes, the summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) analysis provides a useful cutoff-free summary over studies. Recently, this methodology has been extended to the time-dependent SROC analysis for time-to-event outcomes in meta-analysis of prognosis studies. In this paper, we propose a sensitivity analysis method for evaluating the impact of publication bias on the time-dependent SROC analysis. Our proposal extends the recently introduced sensitivity analysis method for meta-analysis of diagnostic studies based on the bivariate normal model on sensitivity and specificity pairs. To model the selective publication process specific to prognosis studies, we introduce a trivariate model on the time-dependent sensitivity and specificity and the log-transformed HR. Based on the proved asymptotic property of the trivariate model, we introduce a likelihood based sensitivity analysis method based on the conditional likelihood constrained by the expected proportion of published studies. We illustrate the proposed sensitivity analysis method through the meta-analysis of Ki67 for breast cancer. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.",
