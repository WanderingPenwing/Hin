        "content": "Thermal transient measurement based on source-drain voltage is a standard method to characterize thermal properties of silicon semiconductors but is doubtful to be directly applied to silicon carbide (SiC) devices. To evaluate its feasibility and limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive investigation into its accuracy, resolution, and stability towards yielding the structure information of SiC MOSFET using the source-drain voltage as the temperature sensitive electrical parameter. The whole characterization process involves two main procedures and associated key testing parameters, such as gate voltages, sensing and heating currents, etc. Their impacts on both the static and dynamic performances are also investigated with the aim of providing a guideline for conducting a reproducible thermal transient measurement for SiC MOSFETs.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-01-15T22:21:05",
        "content": "The reliability of power semiconductor switches is important when considering their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea applications. Respect to technology advancements in material sciences, power MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si) based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs. Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET, CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a real application such as downhole motor drives.",

A single photovoltaic cell produces voltage of low level. In order to boost up the voltage, a DC-DC boost converter is used. In order to use this DC-DC converter for high voltage and high frequency applications, Silicon Carbide (SiC) device is most preferred because of larger current carrying capability, higher voltage blocking capability, high operating temperature and less static and dynamic losses than the traditional silicon (Si) power switches. In the proposed work, the static and dynamic characteristics of SiC MOSFET for different temperatures are observed. A SiC MOSFET based boost converter is investigated which is powered by PV source. This DC - DC converter is controlled using a Pulse-Width Method (PWM) and the duty cycle d is calculated for tracking the maximum power point using incremental conductance algorithm of the PV systems implemented in FPGA. Simulation studies are carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK.A prototype of the SiC converter is built and the results are verified experimentally. The performance parameters of the proposed converter such as output voltage ripple input current ripple and losses are computed and it is compared with the classical silicon (Si) MOSFET converter.",

        "content": "Compared with silicon (Si) power devices, Silicon carbide (SiC) devices have the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-resistance. However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs. All the parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the datasheet, which is practical in power electronics design.",

        "content": "Inverse modelling with deep learning algorithms involves training deep architecture to predict device's parameters from its static behaviour. Inverse device modelling is suitable to reconstruct drifted physical parameters of devices temporally degraded or to retrieve physical configuration. There are many variables that can influence the performance of an inverse modelling method. In this work the authors propose a deep learning method trained for retrieving physical parameters of Level-3 model of Power Silicon-Carbide MOSFET (SiC Power MOS). The SiC devices are used in applications where classical silicon devices failed due to high-temperature or high switching capability. The key application of SiC power devices is in the automotive field (i.e. in the field of electrical vehicles). Due to physiological degradation or high-stressing environment, SiC Power MOS shows a significant drift of physical parameters which can be monitored by using inverse modelling. The aim of this work is to provide a possible deep learning-based solution for retrieving physical parameters of the SiC Power MOSFET. Preliminary results based on the retrieving of channel length of the device are reported. Channel length of power MOSFET is a key parameter involved in the static and dynamic behaviour of the device. The experimental results reported in this work confirmed the effectiveness of a multi-layer perceptron designed to retrieve this parameter.",

Low on-resistance and low input capacitance of GaN HEMTs are suitable for a high-frequency gate driver from the logic level, and robustness of SiC MOSFET with high avalanche capability is suitable for a valve transistor in power converters. Our proposed gate driver consists of digital isolators, complementary Si MOSFETs, and GaN HEMTs. The GaN HEMT push-pull stage has a high driving capability owing to its superior switching characteristics, and complementary Si MOSFETs can enhance the control signal from the digital isolator. We investigated limiting factors of the switching frequency of the proposed gate driver by focusing on each circuit component and proposed an improved driving configuration for the gate driver. As a result, 20-MHz hard switching of a SiC MOSFET was achieved using the improved gate driver with GaN HEMTs.",

        "content": "Ulta-wide bandgap semiconductors based on $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ offer the potential to achieve higher power switching performance, efficiency, and lower manufacturing cost than today's wide bandgap power semiconductors. However, the most critical challenge to the commercialization of Ga$_2$O$_3$ electronics is overheating, which impacts the device's performance and reliability. We fabricated a Ga$_2$O$_3$/4H-SiC composite wafer using a fusion-bonding method. A low temperature ($\\le$ 600 $^{\\circ}$C) epitaxy and device processing approach based on low-temperature (LT) metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy is developed to grow a Ga$_2$O$_3$ epitaxial channel layer on the composite wafer and subsequently fabricate into Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs. This LT approach is essential to preserve the structural integrity of the composite wafer. These LT-grown epitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSFETs deliver high thermal performance (56% reduction in channel temperature), high voltage blocking capabilities up to 2.45 kV, and power figures of merit of $\\sim$ 300 MW/cm$^2$, which is a record high for any heterogeneously integrated Ga$_2$O$_3$ devices reported to date. This work is the first realization of multi-kilovolt homoepitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs fabricated on a composite substrate with high heat transfer performance which delivers state-of-the-art power density values while running much cooler than those on native substrates. Thermal characterization and modeling results reveal that a Ga$_2$O$_3$/diamond composite wafer with a reduced Ga$_2$O$_3$ thickness ($\\sim$ 1 $\\mu$m) and thinner bonding interlayer ($<$ 10 nm) can reduce the device thermal impedance to a level lower than today's GaN-on-SiC power switches.",

        "content": "In this work, the origin of the low free electron mobility in SiC MOSFETs is investigated using the scattering theory of two-dimensional electron gases. We first establish that neither phonon scattering nor Coulomb scattering can be the cause of the low observed mobility in SiC MOSFETs; we establish this fact by comparing the theoretically calculated mobility considering these effects with experimental observations. By considering the threshold voltages and the effective field dependence of the mobility in SiC MOSFETs, it is concluded that the scattering centers of the dominant mechanism are electrically neutral and exhibit a short-range scattering potential. By considering charge distribution around a neutral defect at the interface, it is established that an electric dipole induced by the defect can act as a short-range scattering potential. We then calculate the mobility in SiC MOSFETs assuming that there exist a high density of dipoles at the interface. The calculated dipole-scattering-limited mobility shows a similar dependence on the effective field dependence to that observed in experimental results. Thus, we conclude that scattering induced by a high density of electric dipoles at the interface is dominant cause of the low mobility in SiC MOSFETs.",

The temperature dependent instability of the threshold voltage in lateral MOSFETs is investigated and two separated trapping mechanisms were found. One mechanism is nearly temperature independent and it is correlated to the presence of near interface oxide traps that are trapped via tunneling from the semiconductor. The second mechanism, having an activation energy of 0.1 eV, has been correlated to the presence of intrinsic defects at the SiO$_2$/4H-SiC interface.",

        "content": "Compared with silicon (Si) power devices, Silicon carbide (SiC) devices have the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-resistance. However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs. All the parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the datasheet, which is practical in power electronics design.",

        "content": "In this work, the origin of the low free electron mobility in SiC MOSFETs is investigated using the scattering theory of two-dimensional electron gases. We first establish that neither phonon scattering nor Coulomb scattering can be the cause of the low observed mobility in SiC MOSFETs; we establish this fact by comparing the theoretically calculated mobility considering these effects with experimental observations. By considering the threshold voltages and the effective field dependence of the mobility in SiC MOSFETs, it is concluded that the scattering centers of the dominant mechanism are electrically neutral and exhibit a short-range scattering potential. By considering charge distribution around a neutral defect at the interface, it is established that an electric dipole induced by the defect can act as a short-range scattering potential. We then calculate the mobility in SiC MOSFETs assuming that there exist a high density of dipoles at the interface. The calculated dipole-scattering-limited mobility shows a similar dependence on the effective field dependence to that observed in experimental results. Thus, we conclude that scattering induced by a high density of electric dipoles at the interface is dominant cause of the low mobility in SiC MOSFETs.",

        "content": "The reliability of power semiconductor switches is important when considering their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea applications. Respect to technology advancements in material sciences, power MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si) based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs. Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET, CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a real application such as downhole motor drives.",

        "content": "In this paper, the single-event burnout (SEB) and reinforcement structure of 1200 V SiC MOSFET (SG-SBD-MOSFET) with split gate and Schottky barrier diode (SBD) embedded were studied. The device structure was established using Sentaurus TCAD, and the transient current changes of single-event effect (SEE), SEB threshold voltage, as well as the regularity of electric field peak distribution transfer were studied when heavy ions were incident from different regions of the device. Based on SEE analysis of the new structural device, two reinforcement structure designs for SEB resistance were studied, namely the expansion of the P+ body contact area and the design of a multi-layer N-type interval buffer layer. Firstly, two reinforcement schemes for SEB were analyzed separately, and then comprehensive design and analysis were carried out. The results showed that the SEB threshold voltage of heavy ions incident from the N+ source region was increased by 16% when using the P+ body contact area extension alone; when the device is reinforced with a multi-layer N-type interval buffer layer alone, the SEB threshold voltage increases by 29%; the comprehensive use of the P+ body contact area expansion and a multi-layer N-type interval buffer layer reinforcement increased the SEB threshold voltage by 33%. Overall, the breakdown voltage of the reinforced device decreased from 1632.935 V to 1403.135 V, which can be seen as reducing the remaining redundant voltage to 17%. The device's performance was not significantly affected.",

        "content": "Inter-terminal capacitances (ITCs) have major influence on the dynamic performance of power SiC MOSFETs. Knowledge of the exact values for the ITCs is required in order to perform accurate and predictive compact model simulations of their dynamic performance. Since commercial SiC MOSFETs are capable of operating in a wide range of temperatures, it is important to know the values of ITCs in the whole temperature range of operation. Direct measurements of the ITCs with standard equipment is possible only at low current levels (i.e. in the off-state (Vgs < Vth) for Vds > 0 V), however their values in the on-state (Vgs>Vth) also influence the MOSFETs switching performance. In this work, ITCs of a planar SiC MOSFET in the on-state are studied by the means of a calibrated TCAD model, revealing substantial temperature dependence in the range of 300-450 K. In the first approximation, this temperature dependence of the ITCs can be explained by a weaker temperature dependence of the MOSFET channel resistance in comparison to its JFET and epitaxial layer resistances. In addition, it is shown that at high frequencies stray inductances of the TO-247-3 package result in a change of the extracted values of the on-state ITCs. This effect is already notable at 1 MHz.",

        "content": "In this paper, we investigated a gate driver using a GaN HEMT push-pull configuration for the high-frequency hard switching of a SiC power MOSFET. Low on-resistance and low input capacitance of GaN HEMTs are suitable for a high-frequency gate driver from the logic level, and robustness of SiC MOSFET with high avalanche capability is suitable for a valve transistor in power converters. Our proposed gate driver consists of digital isolators, complementary Si MOSFETs, and GaN HEMTs. The GaN HEMT push-pull stage has a high driving capability owing to its superior switching characteristics, and complementary Si MOSFETs can enhance the control signal from the digital isolator. We investigated limiting factors of the switching frequency of the proposed gate driver by focusing on each circuit component and proposed an improved driving configuration for the gate driver. As a result, 20-MHz hard switching of a SiC MOSFET was achieved using the improved gate driver with GaN HEMTs.",

        "content": "The origin of dielectric breakdown was studied on 4H-SiC MOSFETs that failed after three months of high temperature reverse bias (HTRB) stress. A local inspection of the failed devices demonstrated the presence of a threading dislocation (TD) at the breakdown location. The nanoscale origin of the dielectric breakdown was highlighted with advanced high-spatial-resolution scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques. In particular, SPM revealed the conductive nature of the TD and a local increase of the minority carrier concentration close to the defect. Numerical simulations estimated a hole concentration 13 orders of magnitude larger than in the ideal 4H-SiC crystal. The hole injection in specific regions of the device explained the failure of the gate oxide under stress. In this way, the key role of the TD in the dielectric breakdown of 4H-SiC MOSFET was unambiguously demonstrated.",

A single photovoltaic cell produces voltage of low level. In order to boost up the voltage, a DC-DC boost converter is used. In order to use this DC-DC converter for high voltage and high frequency applications, Silicon Carbide (SiC) device is most preferred because of larger current carrying capability, higher voltage blocking capability, high operating temperature and less static and dynamic losses than the traditional silicon (Si) power switches. In the proposed work, the static and dynamic characteristics of SiC MOSFET for different temperatures are observed. A SiC MOSFET based boost converter is investigated which is powered by PV source. This DC - DC converter is controlled using a Pulse-Width Method (PWM) and the duty cycle d is calculated for tracking the maximum power point using incremental conductance algorithm of the PV systems implemented in FPGA. Simulation studies are carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK.A prototype of the SiC converter is built and the results are verified experimentally. The performance parameters of the proposed converter such as output voltage ripple input current ripple and losses are computed and it is compared with the classical silicon (Si) MOSFET converter.",

In industrial applications, a common reliability problem in SiC MOSFET is avalanche failure. For applications in an avalanche environment, an improved, vertical, double-diffused MOSFET (VDMOSFET) device has been proposed. In this article, an unclamped inductive switching (UIS) test circuit has been built using the Mixed-Mode simulator in the TCAD simulation software, and the simulation results for UIS are introduced for a proposed SiC-power VDMOSFET by using Sentaurus TCAD simulation software. The simulation results imply that the improved VDMOSFET has realized a better UIS performance compared with the conventional VDMOSFET with a buffer layer (B-VDMOSFET) in the same conditions.

        "content": "A rough interface seems to be one of the possible reasons for low channel mobility (conductivity) in SiC MOSFETs. To evaluate the mobility by interface roughness, we drew a boundary line between amorphous insulator and crystalline 4H-SiC in a cross-sectional image obtained by a transmission electron microscope (TEM), by using the deep learning approach of convolutional neural network (CNN). We show that the CNN model recognizes the interface very well, even when the interface is too rough to draw the boundary line manually. Power spectral density of interface roughness was calculated.",

In this study, a high-frequency random pulse X-ray source of CNT cold cathode combined with a channel electron multiplier (CEM) was built, and its direct current (DC) and pulse emission characteristics were tested. The DC measurement results were used for parameter selection for performing pulse experiments. During the DC test, with the conditions of 2.2 kV CEM bias voltage and 25 kV anode voltage, the anode currents are 141, 250, and 300 μA at grid voltages of 290, 387.6, and 432.2 V, respectively; the corresponding grid field values are 1.45, 1.94, and 2.16 V/μm. During the pulse test, the amplitude-frequency response of the X-ray source reaches 3.58 MHz at 3 dB. The developed pulse X-ray source was introduced into the X-ray communication (XCOM), and the experimental communication rate reached 6 Mbps with the bit-error-rate of 1.1 × 10",

        "content": "We explore transient heat transfer, on the millisecond time-scale, from a narrow, rectangular stainless steel heater cooled from one side by He II confined to a channel of 120 $\\mu$m depth. The helium is isolated from the external bath with the exception of two pin-holes of cross section about 10% that of the channel. We measure the temperatures of both the heater strip and the channel helium during slow-pulse heating that reaches peak power after 9 ms, fast-pulse heating that reaches peak power after 100 $\\mu$s, and step heating that reaches steady power after 100 $\\mu$s. Using the steady state Kapitza heat transfer expression at the interface between heater and helium, and the Gorter-Mellink heat transfer regime in the helium channel, we obtain excellent agreement between simulation and measurement during the first 5 ms of slow-pulse tests. Using instead the measured helium temperature in the Kapitza expression, we obtain excellent agreement between the simulated and measured heater response during the first 150 ms of slow-pulse tests. The same model fails to explain the fast-pulse transient response of the heater and helium, while it can explain the helium response to a step in applied power but not the heater response. The steady state Kapitza expression may therefore not be applicable to heating events that are over within a single millisecond.",

This iHPM integrates a brake circuit, a three-phase Si rectifier, and a three-phase SiC inverter within a single package to achieve a minimal current path. A space-vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) scheme is used to control the inverter power switches. In order to reduce parasitic inductance and power loss, an inductance cancellation design is implemented in the Si rectifier and SiC inverter. The switching transients and their parasitic effects during a three-phase operation are assessed through an electromagnetic-circuit co-simulation model, by which the power loss and efficiency of the iHPM are estimated. The modeled parasitic inductance of the inverter is validated through inductance measurement, and the effectiveness of the simulated results in terms of switching transients and efficiency is verified using the experimental results of the double pulse test and open-loop inverter operation, respectively. In addition, the power loss and efficiency of the SiC MOSFET inverter are experimentally compared against those of a commercial Si IGBT inverter.",

        "content": "We examined the effect of backside insulation on the dynamic on-resistance of lateral p-GaN HEMTs. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic onresistance difference between substrate grounded and substrate floating p-GaN HEMTs, we conducted in-circuit double pulse testing and long-term direct current (DC) bias stress. We have realized that while backside insulation can enhance the breakdown voltage of lateral p-GaN HEMTs, it also comes with a tradeoff in device reliability. Results through Sentaurus TCAD simulation suggest that the use of backside insulation in devices gradually disperses potential to the buffer barrier. As a result, the potential barrier at the buffer edge of the 2DEG channel decreases significantly, leading to considerable electron trappings at buffer traps. This breakdown voltage and reliability tradeoff also applies to HEMT technologies using insulating substrates.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-04-30T15:40:03",
        "content": "The present study proposes a highly accurate lattice Boltzmann direct coupling cell-vertex algorithm, well suited for industrial purposes, making it highly valuable for aeroacoustic applications. It is indeed known that the convection of vortical structures across a grid refinement interface, where cell size is abruptly doubled, is likely to generate spurious noise that may corrupt the solution over the whole computational domain. This issue becomes critical in the case of aeroacoustic simulations, where accurate pressure estimations are of paramount importance. Consequently, any interfering noise that may pollute the acoustic predictions must be reduced. The proposed grid refinement algorithm differs from conventionally used ones, in which an overlapping mesh layer is considered. Instead, it provides a direct connection allowing a tighter link between fine and coarse grids, especially with the use of a coherent equilibrium function shared by both grids. Moreover, the direct coupling makes the algorithm more local and prevents the duplication of points, which might be detrimental for massive parallelization. This work follows our first study (Astoul~\\textit{et al. 2020}) on the deleterious effect of non-hydrodynamic modes crossing mesh transitions, which can be addressed using an appropriate collision model. The Hybrid Recursive Regularized model is then used for this study. The grid coupling algorithm is assessed and compared to a widely-used cell-vertex algorithm on an acoustic pulse test case, a convected vortex and a turbulent circular cylinder wake flow at high Reynolds number.",

        "title": "Power Performance Comparison of SiC-IGBT and Si-IGBT Switches in a Three-Phase Inverter for Aircraft Applications.",
        "content": "The converters used to integrate the ground power station of planes with the utility grid are generally created with silicon-insulated gate bipolar transistor (Si-IGBT)-based semiconductor technologies. The Si-IGBT switch-based converters are inefficient, oversized, and have trouble achieving pure sine wave voltages requirements. The efficiency of the aircraft ground power units (AGPU) can be increased by replacing existing Si-IGBT transistors with silicon carbide (SiC) IGBTs because of the physical constraints of Si-IGBT switches. The primary purpose of this research was to prove that the efficiency increase could be obtained in the case of using SiC-IGBTs in conventional AGPU systems with the realized experimental studies. In this study, three different experimental systems were discussed for this purpose. The first system was the traditional APGU system. The other two systems were single-phase test (SPT) and three-phase inverter systems, respectively. The SPT system and three-phase inverter systems were designed and implemented to compare and make analyses of Si-IGBTs and SiC-IGBTs performance. The efficiency and detailed hard switching behavior comparison were performed between the 1200-V SiC-IGBT- and 1200-V Si-IGBT-based experimental systems. The APGU system and Si-IGBT modules were examined, the switching characteristic and efficiency of the system were obtained in the first experimental study. The second experimental study was carried out on the SPT system. The single-pulse test system was created using Si-IGBTs and SiC-IGBTs switches in the second experimental system. The third experiment included a three-phase-inverter-based test system. The system was created with Si-IGBTs and SiC-IGBTs to compare the two different switch-based inverters under RL loads. The turning off and turning on processes of the IGBT switches were examined and the results were presented. The Si-IGBT efficiency was 77% experimentally in the SPT experimental system. The efficiency of the third experimental system was increased up to 95% by replacing the old Si transistor with a SiC. The efficiency of the three-phase Si-IGBT-based system was 86% for the six-switch case. The efficiencies of the SiC-IGBT-based system were increased to around 92% in the three-phase inverter system experimentally. The findings of the experimental results demonstrated that the SiC-IGBT had a faster switching speed and a smaller loss than the classical Si-IGBT. As a result of the experimental studies, the efficiency increase that could be obtained in the case of using SiC-IGBTs in conventional AGPU systems was revealed.",

        "title": "A predictive model of organic acids separation by chromatography with strong anionic resins in sulfate form.",
        "content": "Organic acids commonly have quite symmetrical chromatography profiles at low pH (< 1.5) with strong anionic resins, but a significant tailing can be observed with succinic and citric acids. Classical adsorption models, like the Langmuir model, fail to predict this behavior, which can have a major influence on mean retention times and profile shapes, therefore on chromatography performances. A new retention model was developed to better predict organic acid separation with strong anionic resin. This model combines a refined Langmuir adsorption model and an ion-exchange model. Organic acid adsorption is assumed to be due to hydrogen bonding with sulfate and hydrogen sulfate counter-anions on the resin. The adsorption capacity depends mostly on molecular size: up to sixteen formic acid molecules could be adsorbed per counter-anions, meanwhile only two succinic acid or one citric acid molecules could be adsorbed. This adsorption model was then embedded in a generic and accurate modeling approach (continuous column with mass balance equations solved by the conservation element/solution element (CE/SE) method). All parameters of this column model were identified by fitting the simulation to experimental results (equilibrium curves and pulse tests). Then, the column model was validated with original experimental results from a binary mixture pulse test (formic and succinic acids). Results show that simulations are much more predictive for multi-component pulse tests, both in terms of profile shape and retention time, which cannot be captured without considering ion-exchange.",

        "content": "The electron cyclotron resonance heating system is one of the most effective plasma heating systems for controlled nuclear fusion. The key part of the system called gyrotron is driven by a high voltage power supply with a rated output power of hundreds of kilowatts. When the system is in operation, breakdowns frequently occur in the gyrotron. During breakdowns, the gyrotron will endure a large volume of energy and may be damaged. A solid-state switch is required to protect it by blocking high voltage (∼40 kV) within 10 microseconds and limiting energy within a few joules. Compared with Si IGBT/MOSFET, SiC MOSFET with higher switching speed is more suitable for the switch. However, rapid switching speed exacerbates the voltage imbalance. To solve the problems, a reliable module named Advanced Chopper Sub-Model based on SiC MOSFETs for a solid-state switch is proposed. The module adopts a voltage-clamped circuit to achieve the capabilities of rapid switching-off speed, as well as low overvoltage and good voltage balancing. In addition, modules connected in series can tolerate large driver time delay. The SPICE simulation and the double-pulse test are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed module. The protection performance test was also conducted by using a spark gap to simulate the breakdown fault. Finally, the switch that consists of 64 series-connected modules has been tested at 30 kV/6 A. The turn-off time is ∼5 µs, and the energy during the turn-off transition is 0.283 J. The results show that the switch has good performance.",

        "content": "Low-voltage-triggered silicon-controlled rectifier (LVTSCR) is expected to provide an electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection for a low-voltage integrated circuit. However, it is normally vulnerable to the latch-up effect due to its extremely low holding voltage. In this paper, a novel LVTSCR embedded with an extra p-type MOSFET called EP-LVTSCR has been proposed and verified in a 28-nm CMOS technology. The proposed device possesses a lower trigger voltage of ~ 6.2 V and a significantly higher holding voltage of ~ 5.5 V with only 23% degradation of the failure current under the transmission line pulse test. It is also shown that the EP-LVTSCR operates with a lower turn-on resistance of ~ 1.8 Ω as well as a reliable leakage current of ~ 1.8 nA measured at 3.63 V, making it suitable for ESD protections in 2.5 V/3.3 V CMOS processes. Moreover, the triggering mechanism and conduction characteristics of the proposed device were explored and demonstrated with TCAD simulation.",

        "title": "Cortical disinhibition in Parkinson's disease.",
        "content": "In Parkinson's disease, striatal dopamine depletion produces profound alterations in the neural activity of the cortico-basal ganglia motor loop, leading to dysfunctional motor output and parkinsonism. A key regulator of motor output is the balance between excitation and inhibition in the primary motor cortex, which can be assessed in humans with transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques. Despite decades of research, the functional state of cortical inhibition in Parkinson's disease remains uncertain. Towards resolving this issue, we applied paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation protocols in 166 patients with Parkinson's disease (57 levodopa-naïve, 50 non-dyskinetic, 59 dyskinetic) and 40 healthy controls (age-matched with the levodopa-naïve group). All patients were studied OFF medication. All analyses were performed with fully automatic procedures to avoid confirmation bias, and we systematically considered and excluded several potential confounding factors such as age, gender, resting motor threshold, EMG background activity and amplitude of the motor evoked potential elicited by the single-pulse test stimuli. Our results show that short-interval intracortical inhibition is decreased in Parkinson's disease compared to controls. This reduction of intracortical inhibition was obtained with relatively low-intensity conditioning stimuli (80% of the resting motor threshold) and was not associated with any significant increase in short-interval intracortical facilitation or intracortical facilitation with the same low-intensity conditioning stimuli, supporting the involvement of cortical inhibitory circuits. Short-interval intracortical inhibition was similarly reduced in levodopa-naïve, non-dyskinetic and dyskinetic patients. Importantly, intracortical inhibition was reduced compared to control subjects also on the less affected side (n = 145), even in de novo drug-naïve patients in whom the less affected side was minimally symptomatic (lateralized Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III = 0 or 1, n = 23). These results suggest that cortical disinhibition is a very early, possibly prodromal feature of Parkinson's disease.",

        "title": "The plant early recombinosome: a high security complex to break DNA during meiosis.",
        "content": "The formacion of numerous unpredictable DNA Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) on chromosomes iniciates meiotic recombination. In this perspective, we propose a 'multi-key lock' model to secure the risky but necesary breaks as well as a 'one per pair of cromatids' model for the topoisomerase-like early recombinosome. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes recombine at few sites of crossing-overs (COs) to ensure correct segregation. The initiation of meiotic recombination involves the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) during prophase I. Too many DSBs are dangerous for genome integrity: if these DSBs are not properly repaired, it could potentially lead to chromosomal fragmentation. Too few DSBs are also problematic: if the obligate CO cannot form between bivalents, catastrophic unequal segregation of univalents lead to the formation of sterile aneuploid spores. Research on the regulation of the formation of these necessary but risky DSBs has recently advanced in yeast, mammals and plants. DNA DSBs are created by the enzymatic activity of the early recombinosome, a topoisomerase-like complex containing SPO11. This opinion paper reviews recent insights on the regulation of the SPO11 cofactors necessary for the introduction of temporally and spatially controlled DSBs. We propose that a 'multi-key-lock' model for each subunit of the early recombinosome complex is required to secure the formation of DSBs. We also discuss the hypothetical implications that the established topoisomerase-like nature of the SPO11 core-complex can have in creating DSB in only one of the two replicated chromatids of early prophase I meiotic chromosomes. This hypothetical 'one per pair of chromatids' DSB formation model could optimize the faithful repair of the self-inflicted DSBs. Each DSB could use three potential intact homologous DNA sequences as repair template: one from the sister chromatid and the two others from the homologous chromosomes.",

        "content": "Phase retrieval (PR) concerns the recovery of complex phases from complex magnitudes. We identify the connection between the difficulty level and the number and variety of symmetries in PR problems. We focus on the most difficult far-field PR (FFPR), and propose a novel method using double deep image priors. In realistic evaluation, our method outperforms all competing methods by large margins. As a single-instance method, our method requires no training data and minimal hyperparameter tuning, and hence enjoys good practicality.",

        "content": "Laser interferometric gravitational-wave detectors implement Fabry-Perot cavities to increase their peak sensitivity. However, this is at cost of reducing their detection bandwidth, which origins from the propagation phase delay of the light. The \"white-light-cavity\" idea, first proposed by Wicht et al. [Optics Communications 134, 431 (1997)], is to circumvent this limitation by introducing anomalous dispersion, using double-pumped gain medium, to compensate for such phase delay. In this article, starting from the Hamiltonian of atom-light interaction, we apply the input-output formalism to evaluate the quantum noise of the system. We find that apart from the additional noise associated with the parametric amplification process noticed by others, the stability condition for the entire system poses an additional constraint. Through surveying the parameter regimes where the gain medium remains stable (not lasing) and stationary, we find that there is no net enhancement of the shot-noise limited sensitivity. Therefore, other gain mediums or different parameter regimes shall be explored for realizing the white light cavity.",

        "content": "Spatial attention bias reflects tendency to direct attention to specific side in space. This bias reflects asymmetric dopamine (DA) signaling in the striatum. Administration of DA agonists reduces spatial bias, yet the underlying mechanism is not yet clear. To address this, the current study tested whether methylphenidate (MPH; an indirect DA agonist) reduces orienting bias by modulating fronto-striatal connectivity. 54 adults with consistent bias completed the greyscales task which detects subtle biases during fMRI scanning under MPH (20 mg) or placebo, in a double-blind design. As hypothesized, MPH reduced bias by increasing orienting towards non-preferred hemispace, regardless of whether the initial bias was left or right. MPH-induced increases were found in activation of the medial superior frontal gyrus (mSFG: F[1;53] = 4.632, cluster-defining threshold of P < 0.05, minimal cluster size = 0, p_FWE = 0.036, η2 = 0.08) and its functional connectivity with the caudate (left caudate: F[1;53] = 12.664, p_FWE = 0.001, η2 = 0.192; right caudate: F[1;53] = 11.069, p_FWE = 0.002, η2 = 0.172), when orienting towards the non-preferred hemispace. MPH also reduced mSFG activation and fronto-striatal connectivity for the preferred hemispace. Results suggest modulation of frontal excitability due to increased caudate-mSFG functional connectivity. This mechanism may underlie the positive effect of dopaminergic agonists on abnormal patterns of directing attention in space.",

        "content": "Many real world tasks require multiple agents to work together. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been proposed in recent years to solve these tasks, but current methods often fail to efficiently learn policies. We thus investigate the presence of a common weakness in single-agent RL, namely value function overestimation bias, in the multi-agent setting. Based on our findings, we propose an approach that reduces this bias by using double centralized critics. We evaluate it on six mixed cooperative-competitive tasks, showing a significant advantage over current methods. Finally, we investigate the application of multi-agent methods to high-dimensional robotic tasks and show that our approach can be used to learn decentralized policies in this domain.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-08-27T06:15:00",
        "content": "A quantum receiver is an essential element of quantum illumination (QI) which outperforms its classical counterpart, called classical-illumination (CI). However, there are only few proposals for realizable quantum receiver, which exploits nonlinear effects leading to increasing the complexity of receiver setups. To compensate this, in this article, we design a quantum receiver with linear optical elements for Gaussian QI. Rather than exploiting nonlinear effect, our receiver consists of a 50:50 beam splitter and homodyne detection. Using double homodyne detection after the 50:50 beam splitter, we analyze the performance of the QI in different regimes of target reflectivity, source power, and noise level. We show that our receiver has better signal-to-noise ratio and more robust against noise than the existing simple-structured receivers.",

        "title": "Recent Progress on Stability of Layered Double Hydroxide-Based Catalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction.",
        "content": "Water electrolysis is regarded as one of the most viable technologies for the generation of green hydrogen. Nevertheless, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) constitutes a substantial obstacle to the large-scale deployment of this technology, due to the considerable overpotential resulting from the retardation kinetics associated with the OER. The development of low-cost, high-activity, and long-lasting OER catalysts has emerged as a pivotal research area. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have garnered significant attention due to their suitability for use with base metals, which are cost-effective and exhibit enhanced activity. However, the current performance of LDHs OER catalysts is still far from meeting the demands of industrial applications, particularly in terms of their long-term stability. In this review, we provide an overview of the causes for the deactivation of LDHs OER catalysts and present an analysis of the various mechanisms employed to improve the stability of these catalysts, including the synthesis of LDH ultrathin nanosheets, adjustment of components and doping, dissolution and redeposition, defect creation and corrosion, and utilization of advanced carbon materials.",

        "content": "Next-generation mobile networks have proposed the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as aerial base stations (UAV-BS) to serve ground nodes. Despite having advantages of using UAV-BSs, their dependence on the on-board, limited-capacity battery hinders their service continuity. Shorter trajectories can save flying energy, however, UAV-BSs must also serve nodes based on their service priority since nodes' service requirements are not always the same. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient trajectory optimization for a UAV assisted IoT system in which the UAV-BS considers the IoT nodes' service priorities in making its movement decisions. We solve the trajectory optimization problem using Double Q-Learning algorithm. Simulation results reveal that the Q-Learning based optimized trajectory outperforms a benchmark algorithm, namely Greedily-served algorithm, in terms of reducing the average energy consumption of the UAV-BS as well as the service delay for high priority nodes.",

        "title": "Simultaneously Enhancing the Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells by Using P3HT/PEDOT:PSS as a Double Hole Transport Layer.",
        "content": "The stability issue of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has long been of concern to researchers. Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is commonly used as a hole transport layer (HTL) in the inverted PSCs to achieve efficient and stable performance. However, PEDOT:PSS can corrode ITO, affecting device efficiency. Moreover, the hydrophilic nature of PEDOT:PSS compromises device stability. In this work, Poly (3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), known for its good hydrophobicity, was used to modify the surface of PEDOT:PSS, reducing its water absorption and thereby enhancing the efficiency and stability of PSCs. The results reveal that incorporating P3HT effectively enhances the hydrophobicity of PEDOT:PSS. Furthermore, it fosters the development of large-grain perovskite film on the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT bilayer. This enhancement leads to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.78% for PSCs, with an increase by 16% than that of reference cells (17.04% of PCE). Following a duration of 1000 h, the PCE for the device modified with P3HT remains above 90%, while the PCE of the reference device is below 70%. These findings suggest that using P3HT in conjunction with PEDOT:PSS as a bilayer HTL can concurrently and proficiently improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs.",

A combination of spectroscopic and theoretical investigations reveals the dual-functional role of incorporated TPA. It facilitates the deprotonation of OER intermediates while strengthening the Fe-O bond and acting as a molecular fence, ensuring superior OER kinetics and anti-dissolution properties.

In particular, concepts from geometrisation generalise to knotoids, allowing us to characterise invertibility and other properties in the hyperbolic case.

        "content": "This was a prospective, interventional, comparative study conducted on patients with congenital simple severe ptosis. A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.",

It is shown that electrospray ionization (ESI)-like mass spectra of a range of peptides and proteins can be acquired by LAP-MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) as previously demonstrated on a homemade LAP-MALDI-Q-TOF setup but without the need of any modification to the commercially available MS equipment used. Multiply charged peptide ions were recorded with a resolution of around 100,000 and a mass accuracy of less than 5 ppm. The higher resolution and mass accuracy of the orbitrap analyzer compared with previously employed Q-TOF instrumentation provided high confidence in bacterial proteoform and species identification by top-down protein analysis.",

        "title": "A Method for Treating Significant Conformational Changes in Alchemical Free Energy Simulations of Protein-Ligand Binding.",
        "content": "Relative binding free energy (RBFE) simulation is a rigorous approach to the calculation of quantitatively accurate binding free energy values for protein-ligand binding in which a reference binder is gradually converted to a target binder through alchemical transformation during the simulation. The success of such simulations relies on being able to accurately sample the correct conformational phase space for each alchemical state; however, this becomes a challenge when a significant conformation change occurs between the reference and target binder-receptor complexes. Increasing the simulation time and using enhanced sampling methods can be helpful, but effects can be limited, especially when the free energy barrier between conformations is high or when the correct target complex conformation is difficult to find and maintain. Current RBFE protocols seed the reference complex structure into every alchemical window of the simulation. In our study, we describe an improved protocol in which the reference structure is seeded into the first half of the alchemical windows, and the target structure is seeded into the second half of the alchemical windows. By applying information about the relevant correct end point conformations to different simulation windows from the beginning, the need for large barrier crossings or simulation prediction of the correct structures during an alchemical simulation is in many cases obviated. In the diverse cases we examine below, the simulations yielded free energy predictions that are satisfactory as compared to experiment and superior to running the simulations utilizing the conventional protocol. The method is straightforward to implement for publicly available FEP workflows.",

        "content": "To explore the cortical microstructural alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) at different stages. 149 PD patients and 76 healthy controls were included. PD patients were divided into early stage PD (EPD) (Hoehn-Yahr stage ≤ 2) and moderate-to-late stage PD (MLPD) (Hoehn-Yahr stage ≥ 2.5) according to their Hoehn-Yahr stages. All participants underwent two-shell diffusion MRI and the images were fitted to Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) model to obtain the neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index (ODI) to reflect the cortical microstructure. We used gray matter-based spatial statistics method to compare the voxel-wise cortical NODDI metrics between groups. Partial correlation was used to correlate the NODDI metrics and global composite outcome in PD patients. Compared with healthy controls, EPD patients showed lower ODI in widespread regions, covering bilateral frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, as well as regional lower NDI in bilateral cingulate and frontal lobes. Compared with healthy controls, MLPD patients showed lower ODI and NDI in more widespread regions. Compared with EPD patients, MLPD patients showed lower ODI in bilateral temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, where the ODI values were negatively correlated with global composite outcome in PD patients. PD patients showed widespread cortical microstructural degeneration, characterized by reduced neurite density and orientation dispersion, and the cortical neuritic microstructure exhibit progressive degeneration during the progression of PD.",

This study reports the occurrence and characterization of STEC from dairy cows and evaluates the inhibition of adherence by catlle anti-STEC antibodies to the HEp-2 cell. From 151 samples, 30% (n = 45) were positive for stx by PCR screening (25.21% of dairy cows and 46.8% of growing calves). From these positive samples, 17 STEC isolates were characterized. In dairy cows, 3 out of 17 samples carried stx2, 3 out of 17 possessed stx1, and 2 out of 17 carried stx1/stx2. In growing cows, 8 out of 17 samples carried stx1 and 1 out of 17 carried stx1/stx2. Other virulence factors such as ehxA, saa, iha, cah, and eae were detected. The strains were typed into 3 E. coli O groups (O26, O91, and O130). The analysis of the HEp-2 adherence assays indicated that all serum from both cattle categories presented high levels of inhibition of adherence. Considering the severity of the symptoms caused by STEC in humans, searching for factors influencing the colonization of STEC in cattle would help identify strategies to avoid transmission and STEC infection.",

        "content": "Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a transboundary, viral disease of cattle with a significant economic impact on the livestock industry. This study describes the epidemiological investigations of outbreaks of LSD that occurred in 2022 in three Indian states viz., Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan and the genetic characterization of Lumpy skin disease viruses (LSDVs). Also, the population structure analysis of LSDVs was carried out. Out of 138 scab samples tested from suspected cattle for LSDV, 106 were found positive. Of these, nine representative scab samples were further genetically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis based on the P32 and EEV gene sequences depicted that the LSDV strains of the present study had nucleotide identity of 100% and 99.10-99.45%, respectively with the LSDV/2019 field strains of India. Multiple sequence alignment of the EEV glycoprotein gene sequences revealed nucleotide polymorphisms at three positions viz., G178A, G253A and A459G in circulating LSDV/2022 field strains. Based on the median joining network analysis of the EEV gene, 12 haplotypes were identified among the LSDV populations. Population structure analysis corresponding to the EEV gene revealed high haplotype (0.8486 ± 0.026) and low nucleotide diversities (0.00636 ± 0.0006) and negative values for neutrality indices, indicating a high number of closely related haplotypes and the studied population may have undergone a recent expansion. The findings will help in understanding the distribution and dynamics of LSDV populations, which will prove pivotal in designing and implementing effective management and control strategies.",

Plasmonic nanoparticles have emerged as a tool for confining light on nanometer-length scales where regions of intense electromagnetic fields can be precisely tuned for controlled surface chemistry. We demonstrate a precision pH-driven synthesis of gold nanorods with optical resonance properties widely tunable across the near-infrared spectrum. Through controlled electrostatic interactions, we can perform selective adsorbate molecule attachment and monitor the surface transitions through spectroscopic techniques that include ground-state absorption spectrophotometry, two-dimensional X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.

The present paper reports the green synthesis of CuO NPs and B-doped CuO NPs (B-CuO NPs) from Livistona chinensis leaf extract. Not much work has been reported on the use of the plant extract for the fabrication of NPs, particularly those of Cu and its doped counterparts. Various spectroscopic techniques were used to characterize the synthesized NPs. In the FT-IR spectra, peaks obtained at 504 cm-1 to 600 cm-1 were due to Cu-O vibrations. The energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) spectra confirmed the CuO NPs' composition and B's presence inside the NPs. The peak pattern in X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum confirmed the crystalline and monoclinic phases of the NPs. The average crystalline size of CuO NPs and B-CuO NPs was 19.56 nm and 17.30 nm respectively. The CuO and B-CuO NPs were tested against three Gram-positive bacterial strains namely Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus and three Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Salmonella abony, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa through Agar well diffusion method and it was found that CuO NPs showed higher activity than B-CuO NPs.",

        "content": "The development of hydrophobic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels, which are typically hydrophilic, could significantly enhance their application as artificial extracellular matrices. In this study, we designed PEG hydrogels with enhanced hydrophobicity through gel-gel phase separation (GGPS), a phenomenon that uniquely enhances hydrophobicity under ambient conditions, and we elucidated the pivotal role of elasticity in this process. We hypothesized that increased elasticity would amplify GGPS, thereby improving the hydrophobicity and cell adhesion on PEG hydrogel surfaces, despite their inherent hydrophilicity. To test this hypothesis, we engineered dilute oligo-PEG gels via a two-step process, creating polymer networks from tetra-PEG clusters with multiple reaction points. These oligo-PEG gels exhibited significantly higher elasticity, turbidity, and shrinkage upon water immersion compared to dilute PEG gels. Detailed characterization through confocal laser scanning microscopy, rheological measurements, and cell adhesion assays revealed distinct biphasic structures, increased hydrophobicity, and enhanced cell attachability in the dilute oligo-PEG gels. Our findings confirm that elasticity is crucial for effective GGPS, providing a novel method for tailoring hydrogel properties without chemical modification. This research introduces a new paradigm for designing biomaterials with improved cell-scaffolding capabilities, offering significant potential for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

        "content": "Compared with silicon (Si) power devices, Silicon carbide (SiC) devices have the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-resistance. However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs. All the parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the datasheet, which is practical in power electronics design.",

        "content": "In this work, the origin of the low free electron mobility in SiC MOSFETs is investigated using the scattering theory of two-dimensional electron gases. We first establish that neither phonon scattering nor Coulomb scattering can be the cause of the low observed mobility in SiC MOSFETs; we establish this fact by comparing the theoretically calculated mobility considering these effects with experimental observations. By considering the threshold voltages and the effective field dependence of the mobility in SiC MOSFETs, it is concluded that the scattering centers of the dominant mechanism are electrically neutral and exhibit a short-range scattering potential. By considering charge distribution around a neutral defect at the interface, it is established that an electric dipole induced by the defect can act as a short-range scattering potential. We then calculate the mobility in SiC MOSFETs assuming that there exist a high density of dipoles at the interface. The calculated dipole-scattering-limited mobility shows a similar dependence on the effective field dependence to that observed in experimental results. Thus, we conclude that scattering induced by a high density of electric dipoles at the interface is dominant cause of the low mobility in SiC MOSFETs.",

A deep trench filled with P-poly-Si combined with the P-SiC region leads to a charge balance effect. Instead of a full-SiC P region in conventional super-junction MOSFET, this new structure reduces the P region in a super-junction MOSFET, thus helping to lower the specific on-resistance.

        "publishedDate": "2020-01-15T22:21:05",
        "content": "The reliability of power semiconductor switches is important when considering their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea applications. Respect to technology advancements in material sciences, power MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si) based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs. Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET, CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a real application such as downhole motor drives.",

        "content": "In this paper, the single-event burnout (SEB) and reinforcement structure of 1200 V SiC MOSFET (SG-SBD-MOSFET) with split gate and Schottky barrier diode (SBD) embedded were studied. The device structure was established using Sentaurus TCAD, and the transient current changes of single-event effect (SEE), SEB threshold voltage, as well as the regularity of electric field peak distribution transfer were studied when heavy ions were incident from different regions of the device. Based on SEE analysis of the new structural device, two reinforcement structure designs for SEB resistance were studied, namely the expansion of the P+ body contact area and the design of a multi-layer N-type interval buffer layer. Firstly, two reinforcement schemes for SEB were analyzed separately, and then comprehensive design and analysis were carried out. The results showed that the SEB threshold voltage of heavy ions incident from the N+ source region was increased by 16% when using the P+ body contact area extension alone; when the device is reinforced with a multi-layer N-type interval buffer layer alone, the SEB threshold voltage increases by 29%; the comprehensive use of the P+ body contact area expansion and a multi-layer N-type interval buffer layer reinforcement increased the SEB threshold voltage by 33%. Overall, the breakdown voltage of the reinforced device decreased from 1632.935 V to 1403.135 V, which can be seen as reducing the remaining redundant voltage to 17%. The device's performance was not significantly affected.",

        "content": "Inter-terminal capacitances (ITCs) have major influence on the dynamic performance of power SiC MOSFETs. Knowledge of the exact values for the ITCs is required in order to perform accurate and predictive compact model simulations of their dynamic performance. Since commercial SiC MOSFETs are capable of operating in a wide range of temperatures, it is important to know the values of ITCs in the whole temperature range of operation. Direct measurements of the ITCs with standard equipment is possible only at low current levels (i.e. in the off-state (Vgs < Vth) for Vds > 0 V), however their values in the on-state (Vgs>Vth) also influence the MOSFETs switching performance. In this work, ITCs of a planar SiC MOSFET in the on-state are studied by the means of a calibrated TCAD model, revealing substantial temperature dependence in the range of 300-450 K. In the first approximation, this temperature dependence of the ITCs can be explained by a weaker temperature dependence of the MOSFET channel resistance in comparison to its JFET and epitaxial layer resistances. In addition, it is shown that at high frequencies stray inductances of the TO-247-3 package result in a change of the extracted values of the on-state ITCs. This effect is already notable at 1 MHz.",

Low on-resistance and low input capacitance of GaN HEMTs are suitable for a high-frequency gate driver from the logic level, and robustness of SiC MOSFET with high avalanche capability is suitable for a valve transistor in power converters. Our proposed gate driver consists of digital isolators, complementary Si MOSFETs, and GaN HEMTs. The GaN HEMT push-pull stage has a high driving capability owing to its superior switching characteristics, and complementary Si MOSFETs can enhance the control signal from the digital isolator. We investigated limiting factors of the switching frequency of the proposed gate driver by focusing on each circuit component and proposed an improved driving configuration for the gate driver. As a result, 20-MHz hard switching of a SiC MOSFET was achieved using the improved gate driver with GaN HEMTs.",

        "content": "The origin of dielectric breakdown was studied on 4H-SiC MOSFETs that failed after three months of high temperature reverse bias (HTRB) stress. A local inspection of the failed devices demonstrated the presence of a threading dislocation (TD) at the breakdown location. The nanoscale origin of the dielectric breakdown was highlighted with advanced high-spatial-resolution scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques. In particular, SPM revealed the conductive nature of the TD and a local increase of the minority carrier concentration close to the defect. Numerical simulations estimated a hole concentration 13 orders of magnitude larger than in the ideal 4H-SiC crystal. The hole injection in specific regions of the device explained the failure of the gate oxide under stress. In this way, the key role of the TD in the dielectric breakdown of 4H-SiC MOSFET was unambiguously demonstrated.",

        "content": "Renewable energy source such as photovoltaic (PV) cell generates power from the sun light by converting solar power to electrical power with no moving parts and less maintenance. A single photovoltaic cell produces voltage of low level. In order to boost up the voltage, a DC-DC boost converter is used. In order to use this DC-DC converter for high voltage and high frequency applications, Silicon Carbide (SiC) device is most preferred because of larger current carrying capability, higher voltage blocking capability, high operating temperature and less static and dynamic losses than the traditional silicon (Si) power switches. In the proposed work, the static and dynamic characteristics of SiC MOSFET for different temperatures are observed. A SiC MOSFET based boost converter is investigated which is powered by PV source. This DC - DC converter is controlled using a Pulse-Width Method (PWM) and the duty cycle d is calculated for tracking the maximum power point using incremental conductance algorithm of the PV systems implemented in FPGA. Simulation studies are carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK.A prototype of the SiC converter is built and the results are verified experimentally. The performance parameters of the proposed converter such as output voltage ripple input current ripple and losses are computed and it is compared with the classical silicon (Si) MOSFET converter.",

The DC measurement results were used for parameter selection for performing pulse experiments. During the DC test, with the conditions of 2.2 kV CEM bias voltage and 25 kV anode voltage, the anode currents are 141, 250, and 300 μA at grid voltages of 290, 387.6, and 432.2 V, respectively; the corresponding grid field values are 1.45, 1.94, and 2.16 V/μm. During the pulse test, the amplitude-frequency response of the X-ray source reaches 3.58 MHz at 3 dB.

        "content": "Compared with silicon (Si) power devices, Silicon carbide (SiC) devices have the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-resistance. However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs. All the parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the datasheet, which is practical in power electronics design.",

        "content": "The formacion of numerous unpredictable DNA Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) on chromosomes iniciates meiotic recombination. In this perspective, we propose a 'multi-key lock' model to secure the risky but necesary breaks as well as a 'one per pair of cromatids' model for the topoisomerase-like early recombinosome. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes recombine at few sites of crossing-overs (COs) to ensure correct segregation. The initiation of meiotic recombination involves the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) during prophase I. Too many DSBs are dangerous for genome integrity: if these DSBs are not properly repaired, it could potentially lead to chromosomal fragmentation. Too few DSBs are also problematic: if the obligate CO cannot form between bivalents, catastrophic unequal segregation of univalents lead to the formation of sterile aneuploid spores. Research on the regulation of the formation of these necessary but risky DSBs has recently advanced in yeast, mammals and plants. DNA DSBs are created by the enzymatic activity of the early recombinosome, a topoisomerase-like complex containing SPO11. This opinion paper reviews recent insights on the regulation of the SPO11 cofactors necessary for the introduction of temporally and spatially controlled DSBs. We propose that a 'multi-key-lock' model for each subunit of the early recombinosome complex is required to secure the formation of DSBs. We also discuss the hypothetical implications that the established topoisomerase-like nature of the SPO11 core-complex can have in creating DSB in only one of the two replicated chromatids of early prophase I meiotic chromosomes. This hypothetical 'one per pair of chromatids' DSB formation model could optimize the faithful repair of the self-inflicted DSBs.

        "publishedDate": "2022-01-11T07:59:48",
        "content": "In this work, the origin of the low free electron mobility in SiC MOSFETs is investigated using the scattering theory of two-dimensional electron gases. We first establish that neither phonon scattering nor Coulomb scattering can be the cause of the low observed mobility in SiC MOSFETs; we establish this fact by comparing the theoretically calculated mobility considering these effects with experimental observations. By considering the threshold voltages and the effective field dependence of the mobility in SiC MOSFETs, it is concluded that the scattering centers of the dominant mechanism are electrically neutral and exhibit a short-range scattering potential. By considering charge distribution around a neutral defect at the interface, it is established that an electric dipole induced by the defect can act as a short-range scattering potential. We then calculate the mobility in SiC MOSFETs assuming that there exist a high density of dipoles at the interface. The calculated dipole-scattering-limited mobility shows a similar dependence on the effective field dependence to that observed in experimental results. Thus, we conclude that scattering induced by a high density of electric dipoles at the interface is dominant cause of the low mobility in SiC MOSFETs.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-01-15T22:21:05",
        "content": "The reliability of power semiconductor switches is important when considering their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea applications. Respect to technology advancements in material sciences, power MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si) based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs. Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET, CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a real application such as downhole motor drives.",

        "publishedDate": "2021-07-22T00:35:44",
        "content": "Inter-terminal capacitances (ITCs) have major influence on the dynamic performance of power SiC MOSFETs. Knowledge of the exact values for the ITCs is required in order to perform accurate and predictive compact model simulations of their dynamic performance. Since commercial SiC MOSFETs are capable of operating in a wide range of temperatures, it is important to know the values of ITCs in the whole temperature range of operation. Direct measurements of the ITCs with standard equipment is possible only at low current levels (i.e. in the off-state (Vgs < Vth) for Vds > 0 V), however their values in the on-state (Vgs>Vth) also influence the MOSFETs switching performance. In this work, ITCs of a planar SiC MOSFET in the on-state are studied by the means of a calibrated TCAD model, revealing substantial temperature dependence in the range of 300-450 K. In the first approximation, this temperature dependence of the ITCs can be explained by a weaker temperature dependence of the MOSFET channel resistance in comparison to its JFET and epitaxial layer resistances. In addition, it is shown that at high frequencies stray inductances of the TO-247-3 package result in a change of the extracted values of the on-state ITCs. This effect is already notable at 1 MHz.",

Low on-resistance and low input capacitance of GaN HEMTs are suitable for a high-frequency gate driver from the logic level, and robustness of SiC MOSFET with high avalanche capability is suitable for a valve transistor in power converters. Our proposed gate driver consists of digital isolators, complementary Si MOSFETs, and GaN HEMTs. The GaN HEMT push-pull stage has a high driving capability owing to its superior switching characteristics, and complementary Si MOSFETs can enhance the control signal from the digital isolator. We investigated limiting factors of the switching frequency of the proposed gate driver by focusing on each circuit component and proposed an improved driving configuration for the gate driver. As a result, 20-MHz hard switching of a SiC MOSFET was achieved using the improved gate driver with GaN HEMTs.",

        "content": "Spatial attention bias reflects tendency to direct attention to specific side in space. This bias reflects asymmetric dopamine (DA) signaling in the striatum. Administration of DA agonists reduces spatial bias, yet the underlying mechanism is not yet clear. To address this, the current study tested whether methylphenidate (MPH; an indirect DA agonist) reduces orienting bias by modulating fronto-striatal connectivity. 54 adults with consistent bias completed the greyscales task which detects subtle biases during fMRI scanning under MPH (20 mg) or placebo, in a double-blind design. As hypothesized, MPH reduced bias by increasing orienting towards non-preferred hemispace, regardless of whether the initial bias was left or right. MPH-induced increases were found in activation of the medial superior frontal gyrus (mSFG: F[1;53] = 4.632, cluster-defining threshold of P < 0.05, minimal cluster size = 0, p_FWE = 0.036, η2 = 0.08) and its functional connectivity with the caudate (left caudate: F[1;53] = 12.664, p_FWE = 0.001, η2 = 0.192; right caudate: F[1;53] = 11.069, p_FWE = 0.002, η2 = 0.172), when orienting towards the non-preferred hemispace. MPH also reduced mSFG activation and fronto-striatal connectivity for the preferred hemispace. Results suggest modulation of frontal excitability due to increased caudate-mSFG functional connectivity. This mechanism may underlie the positive effect of dopaminergic agonists on abnormal patterns of directing attention in space.",

        "content": "The origin of dielectric breakdown was studied on 4H-SiC MOSFETs that failed after three months of high temperature reverse bias (HTRB) stress. A local inspection of the failed devices demonstrated the presence of a threading dislocation (TD) at the breakdown location. The nanoscale origin of the dielectric breakdown was highlighted with advanced high-spatial-resolution scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques. In particular, SPM revealed the conductive nature of the TD and a local increase of the minority carrier concentration close to the defect. Numerical simulations estimated a hole concentration 13 orders of magnitude larger than in the ideal 4H-SiC crystal. The hole injection in specific regions of the device explained the failure of the gate oxide under stress. In this way, the key role of the TD in the dielectric breakdown of 4H-SiC MOSFET was unambiguously demonstrated.",

        "content": "Water electrolysis is regarded as one of the most viable technologies for the generation of green hydrogen. Nevertheless, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) constitutes a substantial obstacle to the large-scale deployment of this technology, due to the considerable overpotential resulting from the retardation kinetics associated with the OER. The development of low-cost, high-activity, and long-lasting OER catalysts has emerged as a pivotal research area. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have garnered significant attention due to their suitability for use with base metals, which are cost-effective and exhibit enhanced activity. However, the current performance of LDHs OER catalysts is still far from meeting the demands of industrial applications, particularly in terms of their long-term stability. In this review, we provide an overview of the causes for the deactivation of LDHs OER catalysts and present an analysis of the various mechanisms employed to improve the stability of these catalysts, including the synthesis of LDH ultrathin nanosheets, adjustment of components and doping, dissolution and redeposition, defect creation and corrosion, and utilization of advanced carbon materials.",

        "content": "Renewable energy source such as photovoltaic (PV) cell generates power from the sun light by converting solar power to electrical power with no moving parts and less maintenance. A single photovoltaic cell produces voltage of low level. In order to boost up the voltage, a DC-DC boost converter is used. In order to use this DC-DC converter for high voltage and high frequency applications, Silicon Carbide (SiC) device is most preferred because of larger current carrying capability, higher voltage blocking capability, high operating temperature and less static and dynamic losses than the traditional silicon (Si) power switches. In the proposed work, the static and dynamic characteristics of SiC MOSFET for different temperatures are observed. A SiC MOSFET based boost converter is investigated which is powered by PV source. This DC - DC converter is controlled using a Pulse-Width Method (PWM) and the duty cycle d is calculated for tracking the maximum power point using incremental conductance algorithm of the PV systems implemented in FPGA. Simulation studies are carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK.A prototype of the SiC converter is built and the results are verified experimentally. The performance parameters of the proposed converter such as output voltage ripple input current ripple and losses are computed and it is compared with the classical silicon (Si) MOSFET converter.",

        "title": "Simultaneously Enhancing the Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells by Using P3HT/PEDOT:PSS as a Double Hole Transport Layer.",
        "content": "The stability issue of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has long been of concern to researchers. Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is commonly used as a hole transport layer (HTL) in the inverted PSCs to achieve efficient and stable performance. However, PEDOT:PSS can corrode ITO, affecting device efficiency. Moreover, the hydrophilic nature of PEDOT:PSS compromises device stability. In this work, Poly (3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), known for its good hydrophobicity, was used to modify the surface of PEDOT:PSS, reducing its water absorption and thereby enhancing the efficiency and stability of PSCs. The results reveal that incorporating P3HT effectively enhances the hydrophobicity of PEDOT:PSS. Furthermore, it fosters the development of large-grain perovskite film on the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT bilayer. This enhancement leads to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.78% for PSCs, with an increase by 16% than that of reference cells (17.04% of PCE). Following a duration of 1000 h, the PCE for the device modified with P3HT remains above 90%, while the PCE of the reference device is below 70%. These findings suggest that using P3HT in conjunction with PEDOT:PSS as a bilayer HTL can concurrently and proficiently improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs.",

To evaluate its feasibility and limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive investigation into its accuracy, resolution, and stability towards yielding the structure information of SiC MOSFET using the source-drain voltage as the temperature sensitive electrical parameter. The whole characterization process involves two main procedures and associated key testing parameters, such as gate voltages, sensing and heating currents, etc. Their impacts on both the static and dynamic performances are also investigated with the aim of providing a guideline for conducting a reproducible thermal transient measurement for SiC MOSFETs.",

SiC-based power electronics are being looked at as a strong alternative for high power spaceborne power electronic systems. The SiC MOSFET has been shown to be most prone to SEB of the radiation effects. The knowledge of SiC MOSFET device degradation and failure mechanisms are reviewed. Additionally, the viability of rad-tolerant SiC MOSFET designs and the methods of SEB simulation are evaluated. A merit system is proposed to consider the performance of radiation tolerance and nominal electrical performance. Criteria needed for high-fidelity SEB simulation are also reviewed. This paper stands as a necessary analytical review to intercede the development of rad-hard power devices for space and extreme environment applications.",

        "content": "This was a prospective, interventional, comparative study conducted on patients with congenital simple severe ptosis. A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.",

        "content": "Renewable energy source such as photovoltaic (PV) cell generates power from the sun light by converting solar power to electrical power with no moving parts and less maintenance. A single photovoltaic cell produces voltage of low level. In order to boost up the voltage, a DC-DC boost converter is used. In order to use this DC-DC converter for high voltage and high frequency applications, Silicon Carbide (SiC) device is most preferred because of larger current carrying capability, higher voltage blocking capability, high operating temperature and less static and dynamic losses than the traditional silicon (Si) power switches. In the proposed work, the static and dynamic characteristics of SiC MOSFET for different temperatures are observed. A SiC MOSFET based boost converter is investigated which is powered by PV source. This DC - DC converter is controlled using a Pulse-Width Method (PWM) and the duty cycle d is calculated for tracking the maximum power point using incremental conductance algorithm of the PV systems implemented in FPGA. Simulation studies are carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK.A prototype of the SiC converter is built and the results are verified experimentally. The performance parameters of the proposed converter such as output voltage ripple input current ripple and losses are computed and it is compared with the classical silicon (Si) MOSFET converter.",

        "content": "Thermal transient measurement based on source-drain voltage is a standard method to characterize thermal properties of silicon semiconductors but is doubtful to be directly applied to silicon carbide (SiC) devices. To evaluate its feasibility and limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive investigation into its accuracy, resolution, and stability towards yielding the structure information of SiC MOSFET using the source-drain voltage as the temperature sensitive electrical parameter. The whole characterization process involves two main procedures and associated key testing parameters, such as gate voltages, sensing and heating currents, etc. Their impacts on both the static and dynamic performances are also investigated with the aim of providing a guideline for conducting a reproducible thermal transient measurement for SiC MOSFETs.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-11-13T02:28:11",
        "content": "Compared with silicon (Si) power devices, Silicon carbide (SiC) devices have the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-resistance. However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs. All the parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the datasheet, which is practical in power electronics design.",

        "content": "In this work, the origin of the low free electron mobility in SiC MOSFETs is investigated using the scattering theory of two-dimensional electron gases. We first establish that neither phonon scattering nor Coulomb scattering can be the cause of the low observed mobility in SiC MOSFETs; we establish this fact by comparing the theoretically calculated mobility considering these effects with experimental observations. By considering the threshold voltages and the effective field dependence of the mobility in SiC MOSFETs, it is concluded that the scattering centers of the dominant mechanism are electrically neutral and exhibit a short-range scattering potential. By considering charge distribution around a neutral defect at the interface, it is established that an electric dipole induced by the defect can act as a short-range scattering potential. We then calculate the mobility in SiC MOSFETs assuming that there exist a high density of dipoles at the interface. The calculated dipole-scattering-limited mobility shows a similar dependence on the effective field dependence to that observed in experimental results. Thus, we conclude that scattering induced by a high density of electric dipoles at the interface is dominant cause of the low mobility in SiC MOSFETs.",

        "content": "This article studies the possibility of controlling the surge impedance of the electric motor in motor drives. The existing solution to suppress (or eliminate) the reflected wave impact on the motor insulation run by a Si-IGBT or SiC-MOSFET-based drive is to use either a sinewave filter or dv/dt filter. The alternative solution suggested in this article is to implement a high-bandwidth electronic circuit at the end of the cable or at the motor terminals to match the surge impedance of the cable and motor. The high-frequency voltage ringing due to the reflected waves in motor drives is around 1 MHz, depending on the cable parameters and the length of the cable. In the proposed method, the electronic circuit can quickly detect the dv/dt rise and fall edges and adjust the electronic circuit equivalent impedance when pulses arrive the motor terminals. Thus, the cable and motor surge impedances can be matched over a short time to prevent reflected waves. As a result, the leakage currents passing through the ball bearing and overvoltage stress on the motor insulation can be suppressed significantly.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-01-15T22:21:05",
        "content": "The reliability of power semiconductor switches is important when considering their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea applications. Respect to technology advancements in material sciences, power MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si) based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs. Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET, CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a real application such as downhole motor drives.",

        "title": "A Method for Treating Significant Conformational Changes in Alchemical Free Energy Simulations of Protein-Ligand Binding.",
        "content": "Relative binding free energy (RBFE) simulation is a rigorous approach to the calculation of quantitatively accurate binding free energy values for protein-ligand binding in which a reference binder is gradually converted to a target binder through alchemical transformation during the simulation. The success of such simulations relies on being able to accurately sample the correct conformational phase space for each alchemical state; however, this becomes a challenge when a significant conformation change occurs between the reference and target binder-receptor complexes. Increasing the simulation time and using enhanced sampling methods can be helpful, but effects can be limited, especially when the free energy barrier between conformations is high or when the correct target complex conformation is difficult to find and maintain. Current RBFE protocols seed the reference complex structure into every alchemical window of the simulation. In our study, we describe an improved protocol in which the reference structure is seeded into the first half of the alchemical windows, and the target structure is seeded into the second half of the alchemical windows. By applying information about the relevant correct end point conformations to different simulation windows from the beginning, the need for large barrier crossings or simulation prediction of the correct structures during an alchemical simulation is in many cases obviated. In the diverse cases we examine below, the simulations yielded free energy predictions that are satisfactory as compared to experiment and superior to running the simulations utilizing the conventional protocol. The method is straightforward to implement for publicly available FEP workflows.",

        "publishedDate": "2021-07-22T00:35:44",
        "content": "Inter-terminal capacitances (ITCs) have major influence on the dynamic performance of power SiC MOSFETs. Knowledge of the exact values for the ITCs is required in order to perform accurate and predictive compact model simulations of their dynamic performance. Since commercial SiC MOSFETs are capable of operating in a wide range of temperatures, it is important to know the values of ITCs in the whole temperature range of operation. Direct measurements of the ITCs with standard equipment is possible only at low current levels (i.e. in the off-state (Vgs < Vth) for Vds > 0 V), however their values in the on-state (Vgs>Vth) also influence the MOSFETs switching performance. In this work, ITCs of a planar SiC MOSFET in the on-state are studied by the means of a calibrated TCAD model, revealing substantial temperature dependence in the range of 300-450 K. In the first approximation, this temperature dependence of the ITCs can be explained by a weaker temperature dependence of the MOSFET channel resistance in comparison to its JFET and epitaxial layer resistances. In addition, it is shown that at high frequencies stray inductances of the TO-247-3 package result in a change of the extracted values of the on-state ITCs. This effect is already notable at 1 MHz.",

        "content": "To explore the cortical microstructural alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) at different stages. 149 PD patients and 76 healthy controls were included. PD patients were divided into early stage PD (EPD) (Hoehn-Yahr stage ≤ 2) and moderate-to-late stage PD (MLPD) (Hoehn-Yahr stage ≥ 2.5) according to their Hoehn-Yahr stages. All participants underwent two-shell diffusion MRI and the images were fitted to Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) model to obtain the neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index (ODI) to reflect the cortical microstructure. We used gray matter-based spatial statistics method to compare the voxel-wise cortical NODDI metrics between groups. Partial correlation was used to correlate the NODDI metrics and global composite outcome in PD patients. Compared with healthy controls, EPD patients showed lower ODI in widespread regions, covering bilateral frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, as well as regional lower NDI in bilateral cingulate and frontal lobes. Compared with healthy controls, MLPD patients showed lower ODI and NDI in more widespread regions. Compared with EPD patients, MLPD patients showed lower ODI in bilateral temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, where the ODI values were negatively correlated with global composite outcome in PD patients. PD patients showed widespread cortical microstructural degeneration, characterized by reduced neurite density and orientation dispersion, and the cortical neuritic microstructure exhibit progressive degeneration during the progression of PD.",

Low on-resistance and low input capacitance of GaN HEMTs are suitable for a high-frequency gate driver from the logic level, and robustness of SiC MOSFET with high avalanche capability is suitable for a valve transistor in power converters. Our proposed gate driver consists of digital isolators, complementary Si MOSFETs, and GaN HEMTs. The GaN HEMT push-pull stage has a high driving capability owing to its superior switching characteristics, and complementary Si MOSFETs can enhance the control signal from the digital isolator. We investigated limiting factors of the switching frequency of the proposed gate driver by focusing on each circuit component and proposed an improved driving configuration for the gate driver. As a result, 20-MHz hard switching of a SiC MOSFET was achieved using the improved gate driver with GaN HEMTs.",

This study reports the occurrence and characterization of STEC from dairy cows and evaluates the inhibition of adherence by catlle anti-STEC antibodies to the HEp-2 cell. From 151 samples, 30% (n = 45) were positive for stx by PCR screening (25.21% of dairy cows and 46.8% of growing calves). From these positive samples, 17 STEC isolates were characterized. In dairy cows, 3 out of 17 samples carried stx2, 3 out of 17 possessed stx1, and 2 out of 17 carried stx1/stx2. In growing cows, 8 out of 17 samples carried stx1 and 1 out of 17 carried stx1/stx2. Other virulence factors such as ehxA, saa, iha, cah, and eae were detected. The strains were typed into 3 E. coli O groups (O26, O91, and O130). The analysis of the HEp-2 adherence assays indicated that all serum from both cattle categories presented high levels of inhibition of adherence. Considering the severity of the symptoms caused by STEC in humans, searching for factors influencing the colonization of STEC in cattle would help identify strategies to avoid transmission and STEC infection.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-11-13T02:28:11",
        "content": "Compared with silicon (Si) power devices, Silicon carbide (SiC) devices have the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-resistance. However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs. All the parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the datasheet, which is practical in power electronics design.",

        "content": "In this work, the origin of the low free electron mobility in SiC MOSFETs is investigated using the scattering theory of two-dimensional electron gases. We first establish that neither phonon scattering nor Coulomb scattering can be the cause of the low observed mobility in SiC MOSFETs; we establish this fact by comparing the theoretically calculated mobility considering these effects with experimental observations. By considering the threshold voltages and the effective field dependence of the mobility in SiC MOSFETs, it is concluded that the scattering centers of the dominant mechanism are electrically neutral and exhibit a short-range scattering potential. By considering charge distribution around a neutral defect at the interface, it is established that an electric dipole induced by the defect can act as a short-range scattering potential. We then calculate the mobility in SiC MOSFETs assuming that there exist a high density of dipoles at the interface. The calculated dipole-scattering-limited mobility shows a similar dependence on the effective field dependence to that observed in experimental results. Thus, we conclude that scattering induced by a high density of electric dipoles at the interface is dominant cause of the low mobility in SiC MOSFETs.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-01-15T22:21:05",
        "content": "The reliability of power semiconductor switches is important when considering their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea applications. Respect to technology advancements in material sciences, power MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si) based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs. Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET, CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a real application such as downhole motor drives.",

This study describes the epidemiological investigations of outbreaks of LSD that occurred in 2022 in three Indian states viz., Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan and the genetic characterization of Lumpy skin disease viruses (LSDVs). Also, the population structure analysis of LSDVs was carried out. Out of 138 scab samples tested from suspected cattle for LSDV, 106 were found positive. Of these, nine representative scab samples were further genetically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis based on the P32 and EEV gene sequences depicted that the LSDV strains of the present study had nucleotide identity of 100% and 99.10-99.45%, respectively with the LSDV/2019 field strains of India. Multiple sequence alignment of the EEV glycoprotein gene sequences revealed nucleotide polymorphisms at three positions viz., G178A, G253A and A459G in circulating LSDV/2022 field strains. Based on the median joining network analysis of the EEV gene, 12 haplotypes were identified among the LSDV populations. Population structure analysis corresponding to the EEV gene revealed high haplotype (0.8486 ± 0.026) and low nucleotide diversities (0.00636 ± 0.0006) and negative values for neutrality indices, indicating a high number of closely related haplotypes and the studied population may have undergone a recent expansion. The findings will help in understanding the distribution and dynamics of LSDV populations, which will prove pivotal in designing and implementing effective management and control strategies.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-04-20T20:42:53",
        "content": "Fully-processed SiC power metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) emit light during switching of the gate terminal, while both drain and source terminals are grounded. The emitted photons are caused by defect-assisted recombination of electrons and holes at the 4H-SiC/SiO$_2$ interface and can be detected through the SiC substrate. Here, we present time-gated spectroscopic characterization of these interfacial point defects. Unlike in previous studies, the devices were opened in such a way that the drain-contact remained electrically active. A separate examination of the photons emitted at the rising and falling transitions of the gate-source voltage enabled the extraction of two different spectral components. One of these components consists of a single transition with phonon replicas of a local vibrational mode (LVM) with an astonishingly high energy of 220 meV $\\unicode{x2013}$ well above the highest phonon modes in 4H-SiC and SiO$_2$ of 120 meV and 137 meV, respectively. Based on a quantum mechanical model, we successfully fitted its emission spectrum and assigned it to donor-acceptor pair recombination involving a carbon cluster-like defect. Other transitions were assigned to EH$_{6/7}$-assisted, EK$_2$-D, and nitrogen-aluminum donor-acceptor pair recombination. Due to the relevance of these defects in the operation of SiC MOSFETs, these novel insights will contribute to improved reliability and performance of these devices.",

        "content": "Inter-terminal capacitances (ITCs) have major influence on the dynamic performance of power SiC MOSFETs. Knowledge of the exact values for the ITCs is required in order to perform accurate and predictive compact model simulations of their dynamic performance. Since commercial SiC MOSFETs are capable of operating in a wide range of temperatures, it is important to know the values of ITCs in the whole temperature range of operation. Direct measurements of the ITCs with standard equipment is possible only at low current levels (i.e. in the off-state (Vgs < Vth) for Vds > 0 V), however their values in the on-state (Vgs>Vth) also influence the MOSFETs switching performance. In this work, ITCs of a planar SiC MOSFET in the on-state are studied by the means of a calibrated TCAD model, revealing substantial temperature dependence in the range of 300-450 K. In the first approximation, this temperature dependence of the ITCs can be explained by a weaker temperature dependence of the MOSFET channel resistance in comparison to its JFET and epitaxial layer resistances. In addition, it is shown that at high frequencies stray inductances of the TO-247-3 package result in a change of the extracted values of the on-state ITCs. This effect is already notable at 1 MHz.",

        "content": "In this paper, we investigated a gate driver using a GaN HEMT push-pull configuration for the high-frequency hard switching of a SiC power MOSFET. Low on-resistance and low input capacitance of GaN HEMTs are suitable for a high-frequency gate driver from the logic level, and robustness of SiC MOSFET with high avalanche capability is suitable for a valve transistor in power converters. Our proposed gate driver consists of digital isolators, complementary Si MOSFETs, and GaN HEMTs. The GaN HEMT push-pull stage has a high driving capability owing to its superior switching characteristics, and complementary Si MOSFETs can enhance the control signal from the digital isolator. We investigated limiting factors of the switching frequency of the proposed gate driver by focusing on each circuit component and proposed an improved driving configuration for the gate driver. As a result, 20-MHz hard switching of a SiC MOSFET was achieved using the improved gate driver with GaN HEMTs.",

Plasmonic nanoparticles have emerged as a tool for confining light on nanometer-length scales where regions of intense electromagnetic fields can be precisely tuned for controlled surface chemistry. We demonstrate a precision pH-driven synthesis of gold nanorods with optical resonance properties widely tunable across the near-infrared spectrum. Through controlled electrostatic interactions, we can perform selective adsorbate molecule attachment and monitor the surface transitions through spectroscopic techniques that include ground-state absorption spectrophotometry, two-dimensional X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. We elucidate the electronic, structural, and chemical factors that contribute to plasmon-molecule dynamics at the nanoscale with broad implications for the fields of energy, photonics, and bio-inspired materials.",

        "content": "The origin of dielectric breakdown was studied on 4H-SiC MOSFETs that failed after three months of high temperature reverse bias (HTRB) stress. A local inspection of the failed devices demonstrated the presence of a threading dislocation (TD) at the breakdown location. The nanoscale origin of the dielectric breakdown was highlighted with advanced high-spatial-resolution scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques. In particular, SPM revealed the conductive nature of the TD and a local increase of the minority carrier concentration close to the defect. Numerical simulations estimated a hole concentration 13 orders of magnitude larger than in the ideal 4H-SiC crystal. The hole injection in specific regions of the device explained the failure of the gate oxide under stress. In this way, the key role of the TD in the dielectric breakdown of 4H-SiC MOSFET was unambiguously demonstrated.",

The present paper reports the green synthesis of CuO NPs and B-doped CuO NPs (B-CuO NPs) from Livistona chinensis leaf extract. Not much work has been reported on the use of the plant extract for the fabrication of NPs, particularly those of Cu and its doped counterparts. Various spectroscopic techniques were used to characterize the synthesized NPs. In the FT-IR spectra, peaks obtained at 504 cm-1 to 600 cm-1 were due to Cu-O vibrations. The energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) spectra confirmed the CuO NPs' composition and B's presence inside the NPs. The peak pattern in X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum confirmed the crystalline and monoclinic phases of the NPs. The average crystalline size of CuO NPs and B-CuO NPs was 19.56 nm and 17.30 nm respectively. The CuO and B-CuO NPs were tested against three Gram-positive bacterial strains namely Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus and three Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Salmonella abony, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa through Agar well diffusion method and it was found that CuO NPs showed higher activity than B-CuO NPs.",

        "content": "The development of hydrophobic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels, which are typically hydrophilic, could significantly enhance their application as artificial extracellular matrices. In this study, we designed PEG hydrogels with enhanced hydrophobicity through gel-gel phase separation (GGPS), a phenomenon that uniquely enhances hydrophobicity under ambient conditions, and we elucidated the pivotal role of elasticity in this process. We hypothesized that increased elasticity would amplify GGPS, thereby improving the hydrophobicity and cell adhesion on PEG hydrogel surfaces, despite their inherent hydrophilicity. To test this hypothesis, we engineered dilute oligo-PEG gels via a two-step process, creating polymer networks from tetra-PEG clusters with multiple reaction points. These oligo-PEG gels exhibited significantly higher elasticity, turbidity, and shrinkage upon water immersion compared to dilute PEG gels. Detailed characterization through confocal laser scanning microscopy, rheological measurements, and cell adhesion assays revealed distinct biphasic structures, increased hydrophobicity, and enhanced cell attachability in the dilute oligo-PEG gels. Our findings confirm that elasticity is crucial for effective GGPS, providing a novel method for tailoring hydrogel properties without chemical modification. This research introduces a new paradigm for designing biomaterials with improved cell-scaffolding capabilities, offering significant potential for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

        "content": "Ulta-wide bandgap semiconductors based on $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ offer the potential to achieve higher power switching performance, efficiency, and lower manufacturing cost than today's wide bandgap power semiconductors. However, the most critical challenge to the commercialization of Ga$_2$O$_3$ electronics is overheating, which impacts the device's performance and reliability. We fabricated a Ga$_2$O$_3$/4H-SiC composite wafer using a fusion-bonding method. A low temperature ($\\le$ 600 $^{\\circ}$C) epitaxy and device processing approach based on low-temperature (LT) metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy is developed to grow a Ga$_2$O$_3$ epitaxial channel layer on the composite wafer and subsequently fabricate into Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs. This LT approach is essential to preserve the structural integrity of the composite wafer. These LT-grown epitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSFETs deliver high thermal performance (56% reduction in channel temperature), high voltage blocking capabilities up to 2.45 kV, and power figures of merit of $\\sim$ 300 MW/cm$^2$, which is a record high for any heterogeneously integrated Ga$_2$O$_3$ devices reported to date. This work is the first realization of multi-kilovolt homoepitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs fabricated on a composite substrate with high heat transfer performance which delivers state-of-the-art power density values while running much cooler than those on native substrates. Thermal characterization and modeling results reveal that a Ga$_2$O$_3$/diamond composite wafer with a reduced Ga$_2$O$_3$ thickness ($\\sim$ 1 $\\mu$m) and thinner bonding interlayer ($<$ 10 nm) can reduce the device thermal impedance to a level lower than today's GaN-on-SiC power switches.",

        "content": "We explore transient heat transfer, on the millisecond time-scale, from a narrow, rectangular stainless steel heater cooled from one side by He II confined to a channel of 120 $\\mu$m depth. The helium is isolated from the external bath with the exception of two pin-holes of cross section about 10% that of the channel. We measure the temperatures of both the heater strip and the channel helium during slow-pulse heating that reaches peak power after 9 ms, fast-pulse heating that reaches peak power after 100 $\\mu$s, and step heating that reaches steady power after 100 $\\mu$s. Using the steady state Kapitza heat transfer expression at the interface between heater and helium, and the Gorter-Mellink heat transfer regime in the helium channel, we obtain excellent agreement between simulation and measurement during the first 5 ms of slow-pulse tests. Using instead the measured helium temperature in the Kapitza expression, we obtain excellent agreement between the simulated and measured heater response during the first 150 ms of slow-pulse tests. The same model fails to explain the fast-pulse transient response of the heater and helium, while it can explain the helium response to a step in applied power but not the heater response. The steady state Kapitza expression may therefore not be applicable to heating events that are over within a single millisecond.",

        "title": "The plant early recombinosome: a high security complex to break DNA during meiosis.",
        "content": "The formacion of numerous unpredictable DNA Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) on chromosomes iniciates meiotic recombination. In this perspective, we propose a 'multi-key lock' model to secure the risky but necesary breaks as well as a 'one per pair of cromatids' model for the topoisomerase-like early recombinosome. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes recombine at few sites of crossing-overs (COs) to ensure correct segregation. The initiation of meiotic recombination involves the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) during prophase I. Too many DSBs are dangerous for genome integrity: if these DSBs are not properly repaired, it could potentially lead to chromosomal fragmentation. Too few DSBs are also problematic: if the obligate CO cannot form between bivalents, catastrophic unequal segregation of univalents lead to the formation of sterile aneuploid spores. Research on the regulation of the formation of these necessary but risky DSBs has recently advanced in yeast, mammals and plants. DNA DSBs are created by the enzymatic activity of the early recombinosome, a topoisomerase-like complex containing SPO11. This opinion paper reviews recent insights on the regulation of the SPO11 cofactors necessary for the introduction of temporally and spatially controlled DSBs. We propose that a 'multi-key-lock' model for each subunit of the early recombinosome complex is required to secure the formation of DSBs. We also discuss the hypothetical implications that the established topoisomerase-like nature of the SPO11 core-complex can have in creating DSB in only one of the two replicated chromatids of early prophase I meiotic chromosomes. This hypothetical 'one per pair of chromatids' DSB formation model could optimize the faithful repair of the self-inflicted DSBs. Each DSB could use three potential intact homologous DNA sequences as repair template: one from the sister chromatid and the two others from the homologous chromosomes.",

        "content": "We examined the effect of backside insulation on the dynamic on-resistance of lateral p-GaN HEMTs. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic onresistance difference between substrate grounded and substrate floating p-GaN HEMTs, we conducted in-circuit double pulse testing and long-term direct current (DC) bias stress. We have realized that while backside insulation can enhance the breakdown voltage of lateral p-GaN HEMTs, it also comes with a tradeoff in device reliability. Results through Sentaurus TCAD simulation suggest that the use of backside insulation in devices gradually disperses potential to the buffer barrier. As a result, the potential barrier at the buffer edge of the 2DEG channel decreases significantly, leading to considerable electron trappings at buffer traps. This breakdown voltage and reliability tradeoff also applies to HEMT technologies using insulating substrates.",

        "content": "Spatial attention bias reflects tendency to direct attention to specific side in space. This bias reflects asymmetric dopamine (DA) signaling in the striatum. Administration of DA agonists reduces spatial bias, yet the underlying mechanism is not yet clear. To address this, the current study tested whether methylphenidate (MPH; an indirect DA agonist) reduces orienting bias by modulating fronto-striatal connectivity. 54 adults with consistent bias completed the greyscales task which detects subtle biases during fMRI scanning under MPH (20 mg) or placebo, in a double-blind design. As hypothesized, MPH reduced bias by increasing orienting towards non-preferred hemispace, regardless of whether the initial bias was left or right. MPH-induced increases were found in activation of the medial superior frontal gyrus (mSFG: F[1;53] = 4.632, cluster-defining threshold of P < 0.05, minimal cluster size = 0, p_FWE = 0.036, η2 = 0.08) and its functional connectivity with the caudate (left caudate: F[1;53] = 12.664, p_FWE = 0.001, η2 = 0.192; right caudate: F[1;53] = 11.069, p_FWE = 0.002, η2 = 0.172), when orienting towards the non-preferred hemispace. MPH also reduced mSFG activation and fronto-striatal connectivity for the preferred hemispace. Results suggest modulation of frontal excitability due to increased caudate-mSFG functional connectivity. This mechanism may underlie the positive effect of dopaminergic agonists on abnormal patterns of directing attention in space.",

        "content": "Many real world tasks require multiple agents to work together. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been proposed in recent years to solve these tasks, but current methods often fail to efficiently learn policies. We thus investigate the presence of a common weakness in single-agent RL, namely value function overestimation bias, in the multi-agent setting. Based on our findings, we propose an approach that reduces this bias by using double centralized critics. We evaluate it on six mixed cooperative-competitive tasks, showing a significant advantage over current methods. Finally, we investigate the application of multi-agent methods to high-dimensional robotic tasks and show that our approach can be used to learn decentralized policies in this domain.",

        "content": "Water electrolysis is regarded as one of the most viable technologies for the generation of green hydrogen. Nevertheless, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) constitutes a substantial obstacle to the large-scale deployment of this technology, due to the considerable overpotential resulting from the retardation kinetics associated with the OER. The development of low-cost, high-activity, and long-lasting OER catalysts has emerged as a pivotal research area. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have garnered significant attention due to their suitability for use with base metals, which are cost-effective and exhibit enhanced activity. However, the current performance of LDHs OER catalysts is still far from meeting the demands of industrial applications, particularly in terms of their long-term stability. In this review, we provide an overview of the causes for the deactivation of LDHs OER catalysts and present an analysis of the various mechanisms employed to improve the stability of these catalysts, including the synthesis of LDH ultrathin nanosheets, adjustment of components and doping, dissolution and redeposition, defect creation and corrosion, and utilization of advanced carbon materials.",

        "content": "A quantum receiver is an essential element of quantum illumination (QI) which outperforms its classical counterpart, called classical-illumination (CI). However, there are only few proposals for realizable quantum receiver, which exploits nonlinear effects leading to increasing the complexity of receiver setups. To compensate this, in this article, we design a quantum receiver with linear optical elements for Gaussian QI. Rather than exploiting nonlinear effect, our receiver consists of a 50:50 beam splitter and homodyne detection. Using double homodyne detection after the 50:50 beam splitter, we analyze the performance of the QI in different regimes of target reflectivity, source power, and noise level. We show that our receiver has better signal-to-noise ratio and more robust against noise than the existing simple-structured receivers.",

        "title": "Simultaneously Enhancing the Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells by Using P3HT/PEDOT:PSS as a Double Hole Transport Layer.",
        "content": "The stability issue of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has long been of concern to researchers. Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is commonly used as a hole transport layer (HTL) in the inverted PSCs to achieve efficient and stable performance. However, PEDOT:PSS can corrode ITO, affecting device efficiency. Moreover, the hydrophilic nature of PEDOT:PSS compromises device stability. In this work, Poly (3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), known for its good hydrophobicity, was used to modify the surface of PEDOT:PSS, reducing its water absorption and thereby enhancing the efficiency and stability of PSCs. The results reveal that incorporating P3HT effectively enhances the hydrophobicity of PEDOT:PSS. Furthermore, it fosters the development of large-grain perovskite film on the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT bilayer. This enhancement leads to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.78% for PSCs, with an increase by 16% than that of reference cells (17.04% of PCE). Following a duration of 1000 h, the PCE for the device modified with P3HT remains above 90%, while the PCE of the reference device is below 70%. These findings suggest that using P3HT in conjunction with PEDOT:PSS as a bilayer HTL can concurrently and proficiently improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs.",

        "content": "Next-generation mobile networks have proposed the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as aerial base stations (UAV-BS) to serve ground nodes. Despite having advantages of using UAV-BSs, their dependence on the on-board, limited-capacity battery hinders their service continuity. Shorter trajectories can save flying energy, however, UAV-BSs must also serve nodes based on their service priority since nodes' service requirements are not always the same. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient trajectory optimization for a UAV assisted IoT system in which the UAV-BS considers the IoT nodes' service priorities in making its movement decisions. We solve the trajectory optimization problem using Double Q-Learning algorithm. Simulation results reveal that the Q-Learning based optimized trajectory outperforms a benchmark algorithm, namely Greedily-served algorithm, in terms of reducing the average energy consumption of the UAV-BS as well as the service delay for high priority nodes.",

        "content": "In this paper, we present the spectroscopy of 6P$_{1/2}$ state in $^{87}$Rb using double resonance technique at $780~\\text{nm}$ and $421~\\text{nm}$. The double resonance technique is implemented using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and optical pumping methods. Using these spectroscopy methods, we have measured the hyperfine splitting of 6P$_{1/2}$ state with precision of $<$400~kHz which agrees well with other spectroscopy methods such as electrical discharge and saturated absorption spectroscopy at $421~\\text{nm}$.",

        "content": "We explore transient heat transfer, on the millisecond time-scale, from a narrow, rectangular stainless steel heater cooled from one side by He II confined to a channel of 120 $\\mu$m depth. The helium is isolated from the external bath with the exception of two pin-holes of cross section about 10% that of the channel. We measure the temperatures of both the heater strip and the channel helium during slow-pulse heating that reaches peak power after 9 ms, fast-pulse heating that reaches peak power after 100 $\\mu$s, and step heating that reaches steady power after 100 $\\mu$s. Using the steady state Kapitza heat transfer expression at the interface between heater and helium, and the Gorter-Mellink heat transfer regime in the helium channel, we obtain excellent agreement between simulation and measurement during the first 5 ms of slow-pulse tests. Using instead the measured helium temperature in the Kapitza expression, we obtain excellent agreement between the simulated and measured heater response during the first 150 ms of slow-pulse tests. The same model fails to explain the fast-pulse transient response of the heater and helium, while it can explain the helium response to a step in applied power but not the heater response. The steady state Kapitza expression may therefore not be applicable to heating events that are over within a single millisecond.",

A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.",

We have realized that while backside insulation can enhance the breakdown voltage of lateral p-GaN HEMTs, it also comes with a tradeoff in device reliability. Results through Sentaurus TCAD simulation suggest that the use of backside insulation in devices gradually disperses potential to the buffer barrier. As a result, the potential barrier at the buffer edge of the 2DEG channel decreases significantly, leading to considerable electron trappings at buffer traps. This breakdown voltage and reliability tradeoff also applies to HEMT technologies using insulating substrates.",

Kaczmarz method is a stochastic method for solving overdetermined linear systems based on a sampling of matrix rows. The standard approach to speed up convergence of iterative methods is using preconditioner. As we show the best possible preconditioner for this method can be constructed from QR decomposition of the system matrix, but the complexity of this procedure is too high. Therefore, to reduce this complexity, we use random sketching and compare it with the Kaczmarz method without preconditioning. The developed method is applicable for different modifications of classical Kaczmarz method that were proposed recently. We provide numerical experiments to show the performance of the developed methods on solving both random and real overdetermined linear systems.",

It is not possible to use single scale method to solve problems involving multiple scales. Multiscale methods are needed to solve problems involving multiple scales. In this chapter, meso-macro-multiscale methods are developed by combining various single scale numerical methods, including lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), finite volume method (FVM) and Monte Carlo method (MCM). Macroscale methods include FVM, while LBM and MCM belongs to mesoscale methods. Two strategies exist in combing these numerical methods. For the first one, the whole domain is divided into multiple subdomains and different domains use various numerical methods. Message passing among subdomains decides the accuracy of this type of multiscale numerical method. For the second one, various parameters are solved with different numerical methods. These two types of multiscale methods are both discussed in this chapter.",

As a famous image reconstruction method in computerized tomography, the Kaczmarz method is simple and easy to implement, but its convergence speed is slow, so is the symmetric Kaczmarz method. When the standard forms of the Kaczmarz-Tanabe type methods are obtained, their iteration matrices can be used continuously in the subsequent iterations. Moreover, the iteration matrices can be stored in the image reconstruction devices, which enables the Kaczmarz method and the symmetric Kaczmarz method to be used like the simultaneous iterative reconstructive techniques (SIRT). Meanwhile, theoretical analysis shows that the convergence rate of the symmetric Kaczmarz-Tanabe method is better than that of the Kaczmarz-Tanabe method but is slightly worse than that of two-step Kaczmarz-Tanabe method, which is verified numerically. Numerical experiments also show that the convergence rates of the Kaczmarz-Tanabe method and the symmetric Kaczmarz-Tanabe method are better than those of the SIRT methods.",

        "content": "A liquid atmospheric pressure-matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (LAP-MALDI) method has been developed and applied to a commercial AP-MALDI source on a hybrid orbitrap mass analyzer. It is shown that electrospray ionization (ESI)-like mass spectra of a range of peptides and proteins can be acquired by LAP-MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) as previously demonstrated on a homemade LAP-MALDI-Q-TOF setup but without the need of any modification to the commercially available MS equipment used. Multiply charged peptide ions were recorded with a resolution of around 100,000 and a mass accuracy of less than 5 ppm. The higher resolution and mass accuracy of the orbitrap analyzer compared with previously employed Q-TOF instrumentation provided high confidence in bacterial proteoform and species identification by top-down protein analysis.",

        "title": "A Method for Treating Significant Conformational Changes in Alchemical Free Energy Simulations of Protein-Ligand Binding.",
        "content": "Relative binding free energy (RBFE) simulation is a rigorous approach to the calculation of quantitatively accurate binding free energy values for protein-ligand binding in which a reference binder is gradually converted to a target binder through alchemical transformation during the simulation. The success of such simulations relies on being able to accurately sample the correct conformational phase space for each alchemical state; however, this becomes a challenge when a significant conformation change occurs between the reference and target binder-receptor complexes. Increasing the simulation time and using enhanced sampling methods can be helpful, but effects can be limited, especially when the free energy barrier between conformations is high or when the correct target complex conformation is difficult to find and maintain. Current RBFE protocols seed the reference complex structure into every alchemical window of the simulation. In our study, we describe an improved protocol in which the reference structure is seeded into the first half of the alchemical windows, and the target structure is seeded into the second half of the alchemical windows. By applying information about the relevant correct end point conformations to different simulation windows from the beginning, the need for large barrier crossings or simulation prediction of the correct structures during an alchemical simulation is in many cases obviated. In the diverse cases we examine below, the simulations yielded free energy predictions that are satisfactory as compared to experiment and superior to running the simulations utilizing the conventional protocol. The method is straightforward to implement for publicly available FEP workflows.",

        "content": "A new finite element method with discontinuous approximation is introduced for solving second order elliptic problem. Since this method combines the features of both conforming finite element method and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, we call it conforming DG method. While using DG finite element space, this conforming DG method maintains the features of the conforming finite element method such as simple formulation and strong enforcement of boundary condition. Therefore, this finite element method has the flexibility of using discontinuous approximation and simplicity in formulation of the conforming finite element method. Error estimates of optimal order are established for the corresponding discontinuous finite element approximation in both a discrete $H^1$ norm and the $L^2$ norm. Numerical results are presented to confirm the theory.",

        "content": "To explore the cortical microstructural alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) at different stages. 149 PD patients and 76 healthy controls were included. PD patients were divided into early stage PD (EPD) (Hoehn-Yahr stage ≤ 2) and moderate-to-late stage PD (MLPD) (Hoehn-Yahr stage ≥ 2.5) according to their Hoehn-Yahr stages. All participants underwent two-shell diffusion MRI and the images were fitted to Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) model to obtain the neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index (ODI) to reflect the cortical microstructure. We used gray matter-based spatial statistics method to compare the voxel-wise cortical NODDI metrics between groups. Partial correlation was used to correlate the NODDI metrics and global composite outcome in PD patients. Compared with healthy controls, EPD patients showed lower ODI in widespread regions, covering bilateral frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, as well as regional lower NDI in bilateral cingulate and frontal lobes. Compared with healthy controls, MLPD patients showed lower ODI and NDI in more widespread regions. Compared with EPD patients, MLPD patients showed lower ODI in bilateral temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, where the ODI values were negatively correlated with global composite outcome in PD patients. PD patients showed widespread cortical microstructural degeneration, characterized by reduced neurite density and orientation dispersion, and the cortical neuritic microstructure exhibit progressive degeneration during the progression of PD.",

        "content": "Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is a zoonotic pathogen associated with severe disease. Cattle are recognized as the primary animal reservoir of STEC. This study reports the occurrence and characterization of STEC from dairy cows and evaluates the inhibition of adherence by catlle anti-STEC antibodies to the HEp-2 cell. From 151 samples, 30% (n = 45) were positive for stx by PCR screening (25.21% of dairy cows and 46.8% of growing calves). From these positive samples, 17 STEC isolates were characterized. In dairy cows, 3 out of 17 samples carried stx2, 3 out of 17 possessed stx1, and 2 out of 17 carried stx1/stx2. In growing cows, 8 out of 17 samples carried stx1 and 1 out of 17 carried stx1/stx2. Other virulence factors such as ehxA, saa, iha, cah, and eae were detected. The strains were typed into 3 E. coli O groups (O26, O91, and O130). The analysis of the HEp-2 adherence assays indicated that all serum from both cattle categories presented high levels of inhibition of adherence. Considering the severity of the symptoms caused by STEC in humans, searching for factors influencing the colonization of STEC in cattle would help identify strategies to avoid transmission and STEC infection.",

This study describes the epidemiological investigations of outbreaks of LSD that occurred in 2022 in three Indian states viz., Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan and the genetic characterization of Lumpy skin disease viruses (LSDVs). Also, the population structure analysis of LSDVs was carried out. Out of 138 scab samples tested from suspected cattle for LSDV, 106 were found positive. Of these, nine representative scab samples were further genetically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis based on the P32 and EEV gene sequences depicted that the LSDV strains of the present study had nucleotide identity of 100% and 99.10-99.45%, respectively with the LSDV/2019 field strains of India. Multiple sequence alignment of the EEV glycoprotein gene sequences revealed nucleotide polymorphisms at three positions viz., G178A, G253A and A459G in circulating LSDV/2022 field strains. Based on the median joining network analysis of the EEV gene, 12 haplotypes were identified among the LSDV populations. Population structure analysis corresponding to the EEV gene revealed high haplotype (0.8486 ± 0.026) and low nucleotide diversities (0.00636 ± 0.0006) and negative values for neutrality indices, indicating a high number of closely related haplotypes and the studied population may have undergone a recent expansion. The findings will help in understanding the distribution and dynamics of LSDV populations, which will prove pivotal in designing and implementing effective management and control strategies.",

Plasmonic nanoparticles have emerged as a tool for confining light on nanometer-length scales where regions of intense electromagnetic fields can be precisely tuned for controlled surface chemistry. We demonstrate a precision pH-driven synthesis of gold nanorods with optical resonance properties widely tunable across the near-infrared spectrum. Through controlled electrostatic interactions, we can perform selective adsorbate molecule attachment and monitor the surface transitions through spectroscopic techniques that include ground-state absorption spectrophotometry, two-dimensional X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. We elucidate the electronic, structural, and chemical factors that contribute to plasmon-molecule dynamics at the nanoscale with broad implications for the fields of energy, photonics, and bio-inspired materials.",

The present paper reports the green synthesis of CuO NPs and B-doped CuO NPs (B-CuO NPs) from Livistona chinensis leaf extract. Not much work has been reported on the use of the plant extract for the fabrication of NPs, particularly those of Cu and its doped counterparts. Various spectroscopic techniques were used to characterize the synthesized NPs. In the FT-IR spectra, peaks obtained at 504 cm-1 to 600 cm-1 were due to Cu-O vibrations. The energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) spectra confirmed the CuO NPs' composition and B's presence inside the NPs. The peak pattern in X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum confirmed the crystalline and monoclinic phases of the NPs. The average crystalline size of CuO NPs and B-CuO NPs was 19.56 nm and 17.30 nm respectively. The CuO and B-CuO NPs were tested against three Gram-positive bacterial strains namely Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus and three Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Salmonella abony, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa through Agar well diffusion method and it was found that CuO NPs showed higher activity than B-CuO NPs.",

        "content": "The development of hydrophobic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels, which are typically hydrophilic, could significantly enhance their application as artificial extracellular matrices. In this study, we designed PEG hydrogels with enhanced hydrophobicity through gel-gel phase separation (GGPS), a phenomenon that uniquely enhances hydrophobicity under ambient conditions, and we elucidated the pivotal role of elasticity in this process. We hypothesized that increased elasticity would amplify GGPS, thereby improving the hydrophobicity and cell adhesion on PEG hydrogel surfaces, despite their inherent hydrophilicity. To test this hypothesis, we engineered dilute oligo-PEG gels via a two-step process, creating polymer networks from tetra-PEG clusters with multiple reaction points. These oligo-PEG gels exhibited significantly higher elasticity, turbidity, and shrinkage upon water immersion compared to dilute PEG gels. Detailed characterization through confocal laser scanning microscopy, rheological measurements, and cell adhesion assays revealed distinct biphasic structures, increased hydrophobicity, and enhanced cell attachability in the dilute oligo-PEG gels. Our findings confirm that elasticity is crucial for effective GGPS, providing a novel method for tailoring hydrogel properties without chemical modification. This research introduces a new paradigm for designing biomaterials with improved cell-scaffolding capabilities, offering significant potential for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.",

        "content": "Here, we present a mild and rapid method to access azidobicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes via formal (3 + 2) cycloaddition of α-substituted vinyl azides and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes under Lewis acid catalysis. A wide range of α-substituted vinyl azides were tolerated under mild conditions. Notably, the resulting cycloadducts could be transformed into structurally attractive 3-azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptenes through microwave-promoted rearrangement. The utilities were highlighted by copper(I)-catalyzed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of tertiary alkyl azide and further transformation of the azide and ketone groups.",

        "content": "A liquid atmospheric pressure-matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (LAP-MALDI) method has been developed and applied to a commercial AP-MALDI source on a hybrid orbitrap mass analyzer. It is shown that electrospray ionization (ESI)-like mass spectra of a range of peptides and proteins can be acquired by LAP-MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) as previously demonstrated on a homemade LAP-MALDI-Q-TOF setup but without the need of any modification to the commercially available MS equipment used. Multiply charged peptide ions were recorded with a resolution of around 100,000 and a mass accuracy of less than 5 ppm. The higher resolution and mass accuracy of the orbitrap analyzer compared with previously employed Q-TOF instrumentation provided high confidence in bacterial proteoform and species identification by top-down protein analysis.",

        "title": "A Method for Treating Significant Conformational Changes in Alchemical Free Energy Simulations of Protein-Ligand Binding.",
        "content": "Relative binding free energy (RBFE) simulation is a rigorous approach to the calculation of quantitatively accurate binding free energy values for protein-ligand binding in which a reference binder is gradually converted to a target binder through alchemical transformation during the simulation. The success of such simulations relies on being able to accurately sample the correct conformational phase space for each alchemical state; however, this becomes a challenge when a significant conformation change occurs between the reference and target binder-receptor complexes. Increasing the simulation time and using enhanced sampling methods can be helpful, but effects can be limited, especially when the free energy barrier between conformations is high or when the correct target complex conformation is difficult to find and maintain. Current RBFE protocols seed the reference complex structure into every alchemical window of the simulation. In our study, we describe an improved protocol in which the reference structure is seeded into the first half of the alchemical windows, and the target structure is seeded into the second half of the alchemical windows. By applying information about the relevant correct end point conformations to different simulation windows from the beginning, the need for large barrier crossings or simulation prediction of the correct structures during an alchemical simulation is in many cases obviated. In the diverse cases we examine below, the simulations yielded free energy predictions that are satisfactory as compared to experiment and superior to running the simulations utilizing the conventional protocol. The method is straightforward to implement for publicly available FEP workflows.",

        "content": "To explore the cortical microstructural alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) at different stages. 149 PD patients and 76 healthy controls were included. PD patients were divided into early stage PD (EPD) (Hoehn-Yahr stage ≤ 2) and moderate-to-late stage PD (MLPD) (Hoehn-Yahr stage ≥ 2.5) according to their Hoehn-Yahr stages. All participants underwent two-shell diffusion MRI and the images were fitted to Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) model to obtain the neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index (ODI) to reflect the cortical microstructure. We used gray matter-based spatial statistics method to compare the voxel-wise cortical NODDI metrics between groups. Partial correlation was used to correlate the NODDI metrics and global composite outcome in PD patients. Compared with healthy controls, EPD patients showed lower ODI in widespread regions, covering bilateral frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, as well as regional lower NDI in bilateral cingulate and frontal lobes. Compared with healthy controls, MLPD patients showed lower ODI and NDI in more widespread regions. Compared with EPD patients, MLPD patients showed lower ODI in bilateral temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, where the ODI values were negatively correlated with global composite outcome in PD patients. PD patients showed widespread cortical microstructural degeneration, characterized by reduced neurite density and orientation dispersion, and the cortical neuritic microstructure exhibit progressive degeneration during the progression of PD.",

This study reports the occurrence and characterization of STEC from dairy cows and evaluates the inhibition of adherence by catlle anti-STEC antibodies to the HEp-2 cell. From 151 samples, 30% (n = 45) were positive for stx by PCR screening (25.21% of dairy cows and 46.8% of growing calves). From these positive samples, 17 STEC isolates were characterized. In dairy cows, 3 out of 17 samples carried stx2, 3 out of 17 possessed stx1, and 2 out of 17 carried stx1/stx2. In growing cows, 8 out of 17 samples carried stx1 and 1 out of 17 carried stx1/stx2. Other virulence factors such as ehxA, saa, iha, cah, and eae were detected. The strains were typed into 3 E. coli O groups (O26, O91, and O130). The analysis of the HEp-2 adherence assays indicated that all serum from both cattle categories presented high levels of inhibition of adherence. Considering the severity of the symptoms caused by STEC in humans, searching for factors influencing the colonization of STEC in cattle would help identify strategies to avoid transmission and STEC infection.",

        "content": "Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a transboundary, viral disease of cattle with a significant economic impact on the livestock industry. This study describes the epidemiological investigations of outbreaks of LSD that occurred in 2022 in three Indian states viz., Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan and the genetic characterization of Lumpy skin disease viruses (LSDVs). Also, the population structure analysis of LSDVs was carried out. Out of 138 scab samples tested from suspected cattle for LSDV, 106 were found positive. Of these, nine representative scab samples were further genetically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis based on the P32 and EEV gene sequences depicted that the LSDV strains of the present study had nucleotide identity of 100% and 99.10-99.45%, respectively with the LSDV/2019 field strains of India. Multiple sequence alignment of the EEV glycoprotein gene sequences revealed nucleotide polymorphisms at three positions viz., G178A, G253A and A459G in circulating LSDV/2022 field strains. Based on the median joining network analysis of the EEV gene, 12 haplotypes were identified among the LSDV populations. Population structure analysis corresponding to the EEV gene revealed high haplotype (0.8486 ± 0.026) and low nucleotide diversities (0.00636 ± 0.0006) and negative values for neutrality indices, indicating a high number of closely related haplotypes and the studied population may have undergone a recent expansion. The findings will help in understanding the distribution and dynamics of LSDV populations, which will prove pivotal in designing and implementing effective management and control strategies.",

        "content": "The formacion of numerous unpredictable DNA Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) on chromosomes iniciates meiotic recombination. In this perspective, we propose a 'multi-key lock' model to secure the risky but necesary breaks as well as a 'one per pair of cromatids' model for the topoisomerase-like early recombinosome. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes recombine at few sites of crossing-overs (COs) to ensure correct segregation. The initiation of meiotic recombination involves the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) during prophase I. Too many DSBs are dangerous for genome integrity: if these DSBs are not properly repaired, it could potentially lead to chromosomal fragmentation. Too few DSBs are also problematic: if the obligate CO cannot form between bivalents, catastrophic unequal segregation of univalents lead to the formation of sterile aneuploid spores. Research on the regulation of the formation of these necessary but risky DSBs has recently advanced in yeast, mammals and plants. DNA DSBs are created by the enzymatic activity of the early recombinosome, a topoisomerase-like complex containing SPO11. This opinion paper reviews recent insights on the regulation of the SPO11 cofactors necessary for the introduction of temporally and spatially controlled DSBs. We propose that a 'multi-key-lock' model for each subunit of the early recombinosome complex is required to secure the formation of DSBs. We also discuss the hypothetical implications that the established topoisomerase-like nature of the SPO11 core-complex can have in creating DSB in only one of the two replicated chromatids of early prophase I meiotic chromosomes. This hypothetical 'one per pair of chromatids' DSB formation model could optimize the faithful repair of the self-inflicted DSBs. Each DSB could use three potential intact homologous DNA sequences as repair template: one from the sister chromatid and the two others from the homologous chromosomes.",

A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.",

It is shown that electrospray ionization (ESI)-like mass spectra of a range of peptides and proteins can be acquired by LAP-MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) as previously demonstrated on a homemade LAP-MALDI-Q-TOF setup but without the need of any modification to the commercially available MS equipment used. Multiply charged peptide ions were recorded with a resolution of around 100,000 and a mass accuracy of less than 5 ppm. The higher resolution and mass accuracy of the orbitrap analyzer compared with previously employed Q-TOF instrumentation provided high confidence in bacterial proteoform and species identification by top-down protein analysis.",

        "content": "Relative binding free energy (RBFE) simulation is a rigorous approach to the calculation of quantitatively accurate binding free energy values for protein-ligand binding in which a reference binder is gradually converted to a target binder through alchemical transformation during the simulation. The success of such simulations relies on being able to accurately sample the correct conformational phase space for each alchemical state; however, this becomes a challenge when a significant conformation change occurs between the reference and target binder-receptor complexes. Increasing the simulation time and using enhanced sampling methods can be helpful, but effects can be limited, especially when the free energy barrier between conformations is high or when the correct target complex conformation is difficult to find and maintain. Current RBFE protocols seed the reference complex structure into every alchemical window of the simulation. In our study, we describe an improved protocol in which the reference structure is seeded into the first half of the alchemical windows, and the target structure is seeded into the second half of the alchemical windows. By applying information about the relevant correct end point conformations to different simulation windows from the beginning, the need for large barrier crossings or simulation prediction of the correct structures during an alchemical simulation is in many cases obviated. In the diverse cases we examine below, the simulations yielded free energy predictions that are satisfactory as compared to experiment and superior to running the simulations utilizing the conventional protocol. The method is straightforward to implement for publicly available FEP workflows.",

        "content": "Compared with silicon (Si) power devices, Silicon carbide (SiC) devices have the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-resistance. However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs.

        "content": "In this work, the origin of the low free electron mobility in SiC MOSFETs is investigated using the scattering theory of two-dimensional electron gases. We first establish that neither phonon scattering nor Coulomb scattering can be the cause of the low observed mobility in SiC MOSFETs; we establish this fact by comparing the theoretically calculated mobility considering these effects with experimental observations. By considering the threshold voltages and the effective field dependence of the mobility in SiC MOSFETs, it is concluded that the scattering centers of the dominant mechanism are electrically neutral and exhibit a short-range scattering potential. By considering charge distribution around a neutral defect at the interface, it is established that an electric dipole induced by the defect can act as a short-range scattering potential. We then calculate the mobility in SiC MOSFETs assuming that there exist a high density of dipoles at the interface. The calculated dipole-scattering-limited mobility shows a similar dependence on the effective field dependence to that observed in experimental results. Thus, we conclude that scattering induced by a high density of electric dipoles at the interface is dominant cause of the low mobility in SiC MOSFETs.",

        "content": "The formacion of numerous unpredictable DNA Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) on chromosomes iniciates meiotic recombination. In this perspective, we propose a 'multi-key lock' model to secure the risky but necesary breaks as well as a 'one per pair of cromatids' model for the topoisomerase-like early recombinosome. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes recombine at few sites of crossing-overs (COs) to ensure correct segregation. The initiation of meiotic recombination involves the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) during prophase I. Too many DSBs are dangerous for genome integrity: if these DSBs are not properly repaired, it could potentially lead to chromosomal fragmentation. Too few DSBs are also problematic: if the obligate CO cannot form between bivalents, catastrophic unequal segregation of univalents lead to the formation of sterile aneuploid spores. Research on the regulation of the formation of these necessary but risky DSBs has recently advanced in yeast, mammals and plants. DNA DSBs are created by the enzymatic activity of the early recombinosome, a topoisomerase-like complex containing SPO11. This opinion paper reviews recent insights on the regulation of the SPO11 cofactors necessary for the introduction of temporally and spatially controlled DSBs. We propose that a 'multi-key-lock' model for each subunit of the early recombinosome complex is required to secure the formation of DSBs. We also discuss the hypothetical implications that the established topoisomerase-like nature of the SPO11 core-complex can have in creating DSB in only one of the two replicated chromatids of early prophase I meiotic chromosomes. This hypothetical 'one per pair of chromatids' DSB formation model could optimize the faithful repair of the self-inflicted DSBs. Each DSB could use three potential intact homologous DNA sequences as repair template: one from the sister chromatid and the two others from the homologous chromosomes.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-01-15T22:21:05",
        "content": "The reliability of power semiconductor switches is important when considering their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea applications. Respect to technology advancements in material sciences, power MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si) based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs. Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET, CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a real application such as downhole motor drives.",

        "content": "Inter-terminal capacitances (ITCs) have major influence on the dynamic performance of power SiC MOSFETs. Knowledge of the exact values for the ITCs is required in order to perform accurate and predictive compact model simulations of their dynamic performance. Since commercial SiC MOSFETs are capable of operating in a wide range of temperatures, it is important to know the values of ITCs in the whole temperature range of operation. Direct measurements of the ITCs with standard equipment is possible only at low current levels (i.e. in the off-state (Vgs < Vth) for Vds > 0 V), however their values in the on-state (Vgs>Vth) also influence the MOSFETs switching performance. In this work, ITCs of a planar SiC MOSFET in the on-state are studied by the means of a calibrated TCAD model, revealing substantial temperature dependence in the range of 300-450 K. In the first approximation, this temperature dependence of the ITCs can be explained by a weaker temperature dependence of the MOSFET channel resistance in comparison to its JFET and epitaxial layer resistances. In addition, it is shown that at high frequencies stray inductances of the TO-247-3 package result in a change of the extracted values of the on-state ITCs. This effect is already notable at 1 MHz.",

Low on-resistance and low input capacitance of GaN HEMTs are suitable for a high-frequency gate driver from the logic level, and robustness of SiC MOSFET with high avalanche capability is suitable for a valve transistor in power converters. Our proposed gate driver consists of digital isolators, complementary Si MOSFETs, and GaN HEMTs. The GaN HEMT push-pull stage has a high driving capability owing to its superior switching characteristics, and complementary Si MOSFETs can enhance the control signal from the digital isolator. We investigated limiting factors of the switching frequency of the proposed gate driver by focusing on each circuit component and proposed an improved driving configuration for the gate driver. As a result, 20-MHz hard switching of a SiC MOSFET was achieved using the improved gate driver with GaN HEMTs.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-09-10T13:20:41",
        "content": "The origin of dielectric breakdown was studied on 4H-SiC MOSFETs that failed after three months of high temperature reverse bias (HTRB) stress. A local inspection of the failed devices demonstrated the presence of a threading dislocation (TD) at the breakdown location. The nanoscale origin of the dielectric breakdown was highlighted with advanced high-spatial-resolution scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques. In particular, SPM revealed the conductive nature of the TD and a local increase of the minority carrier concentration close to the defect. Numerical simulations estimated a hole concentration 13 orders of magnitude larger than in the ideal 4H-SiC crystal. The hole injection in specific regions of the device explained the failure of the gate oxide under stress. In this way, the key role of the TD in the dielectric breakdown of 4H-SiC MOSFET was unambiguously demonstrated.",

        "content": "Spatial attention bias reflects tendency to direct attention to specific side in space. This bias reflects asymmetric dopamine (DA) signaling in the striatum. Administration of DA agonists reduces spatial bias, yet the underlying mechanism is not yet clear. To address this, the current study tested whether methylphenidate (MPH; an indirect DA agonist) reduces orienting bias by modulating fronto-striatal connectivity. 54 adults with consistent bias completed the greyscales task which detects subtle biases during fMRI scanning under MPH (20 mg) or placebo, in a double-blind design. As hypothesized, MPH reduced bias by increasing orienting towards non-preferred hemispace, regardless of whether the initial bias was left or right. MPH-induced increases were found in activation of the medial superior frontal gyrus (mSFG: F[1;53] = 4.632, cluster-defining threshold of P < 0.05, minimal cluster size = 0, p_FWE = 0.036, η2 = 0.08) and its functional connectivity with the caudate (left caudate: F[1;53] = 12.664, p_FWE = 0.001, η2 = 0.192; right caudate: F[1;53] = 11.069, p_FWE = 0.002, η2 = 0.172), when orienting towards the non-preferred hemispace. MPH also reduced mSFG activation and fronto-striatal connectivity for the preferred hemispace. Results suggest modulation of frontal excitability due to increased caudate-mSFG functional connectivity. This mechanism may underlie the positive effect of dopaminergic agonists on abnormal patterns of directing attention in space.",

        "content": "Renewable energy source such as photovoltaic (PV) cell generates power from the sun light by converting solar power to electrical power with no moving parts and less maintenance. A single photovoltaic cell produces voltage of low level. In order to boost up the voltage, a DC-DC boost converter is used. In order to use this DC-DC converter for high voltage and high frequency applications, Silicon Carbide (SiC) device is most preferred because of larger current carrying capability, higher voltage blocking capability, high operating temperature and less static and dynamic losses than the traditional silicon (Si) power switches. In the proposed work, the static and dynamic characteristics of SiC MOSFET for different temperatures are observed. A SiC MOSFET based boost converter is investigated which is powered by PV source. This DC - DC converter is controlled using a Pulse-Width Method (PWM) and the duty cycle d is calculated for tracking the maximum power point using incremental conductance algorithm of the PV systems implemented in FPGA. Simulation studies are carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK.A prototype of the SiC converter is built and the results are verified experimentally. The performance parameters of the proposed converter such as output voltage ripple input current ripple and losses are computed and it is compared with the classical silicon (Si) MOSFET converter.",

        "content": "Water electrolysis is regarded as one of the most viable technologies for the generation of green hydrogen. Nevertheless, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) constitutes a substantial obstacle to the large-scale deployment of this technology, due to the considerable overpotential resulting from the retardation kinetics associated with the OER. The development of low-cost, high-activity, and long-lasting OER catalysts has emerged as a pivotal research area. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have garnered significant attention due to their suitability for use with base metals, which are cost-effective and exhibit enhanced activity. However, the current performance of LDHs OER catalysts is still far from meeting the demands of industrial applications, particularly in terms of their long-term stability. In this review, we provide an overview of the causes for the deactivation of LDHs OER catalysts and present an analysis of the various mechanisms employed to improve the stability of these catalysts, including the synthesis of LDH ultrathin nanosheets, adjustment of components and doping, dissolution and redeposition, defect creation and corrosion, and utilization of advanced carbon materials.",

        "content": "The stability issue of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has long been of concern to researchers. Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is commonly used as a hole transport layer (HTL) in the inverted PSCs to achieve efficient and stable performance. However, PEDOT:PSS can corrode ITO, affecting device efficiency. Moreover, the hydrophilic nature of PEDOT:PSS compromises device stability. In this work, Poly (3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), known for its good hydrophobicity, was used to modify the surface of PEDOT:PSS, reducing its water absorption and thereby enhancing the efficiency and stability of PSCs. The results reveal that incorporating P3HT effectively enhances the hydrophobicity of PEDOT:PSS. Furthermore, it fosters the development of large-grain perovskite film on the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT bilayer. This enhancement leads to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.78% for PSCs, with an increase by 16% than that of reference cells (17.04% of PCE). Following a duration of 1000 h, the PCE for the device modified with P3HT remains above 90%, while the PCE of the reference device is below 70%. These findings suggest that using P3HT in conjunction with PEDOT:PSS as a bilayer HTL can concurrently and proficiently improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs.",

        "content": "The efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is severely limited by the sluggish proton-coupled electron transfer processes and inadequate long-term stability. Herein, we introduce a carboxylate group (TPA) to modify NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH@TPA), resulting in notable improvements in both activity and stability. A combination of spectroscopic and theoretical investigations reveals the dual-functional role of incorporated TPA. It facilitates the deprotonation of OER intermediates while strengthening the Fe-O bond and acting as a molecular fence, ensuring superior OER kinetics and anti-dissolution properties. NiFe LDH@TPA delivers a low overpotential of 200 mV at 10 mA cm",

        "content": "Radiation hardening of the MOSFET is of the highest priority for sustaining high-power systems in the space radiation environment. SiC-based power electronics are being looked at as a strong alternative for high power spaceborne power electronic systems. The SiC MOSFET has been shown to be most prone to SEB of the radiation effects. The knowledge of SiC MOSFET device degradation and failure mechanisms are reviewed. Additionally, the viability of rad-tolerant SiC MOSFET designs and the methods of SEB simulation are evaluated. A merit system is proposed to consider the performance of radiation tolerance and nominal electrical performance. Criteria needed for high-fidelity SEB simulation are also reviewed. This paper stands as a necessary analytical review to intercede the development of rad-hard power devices for space and extreme environment applications.",

        "content": "Renewable energy source such as photovoltaic (PV) cell generates power from the sun light by converting solar power to electrical power with no moving parts and less maintenance. A single photovoltaic cell produces voltage of low level. In order to boost up the voltage, a DC-DC boost converter is used. In order to use this DC-DC converter for high voltage and high frequency applications, Silicon Carbide (SiC) device is most preferred because of larger current carrying capability, higher voltage blocking capability, high operating temperature and less static and dynamic losses than the traditional silicon (Si) power switches. In the proposed work, the static and dynamic characteristics of SiC MOSFET for different temperatures are observed. A SiC MOSFET based boost converter is investigated which is powered by PV source. This DC - DC converter is controlled using a Pulse-Width Method (PWM) and the duty cycle d is calculated for tracking the maximum power point using incremental conductance algorithm of the PV systems implemented in FPGA. Simulation studies are carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK.A prototype of the SiC converter is built and the results are verified experimentally. The performance parameters of the proposed converter such as output voltage ripple input current ripple and losses are computed and it is compared with the classical silicon (Si) MOSFET converter.",

        "content": "This was a prospective, interventional, comparative study conducted on patients with congenital simple severe ptosis. A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.",

        "publishedDate": "2022-11-28T09:34:45",
        "content": "Thermal transient measurement based on source-drain voltage is a standard method to characterize thermal properties of silicon semiconductors but is doubtful to be directly applied to silicon carbide (SiC) devices. To evaluate its feasibility and limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive investigation into its accuracy, resolution, and stability towards yielding the structure information of SiC MOSFET using the source-drain voltage as the temperature sensitive electrical parameter. The whole characterization process involves two main procedures and associated key testing parameters, such as gate voltages, sensing and heating currents, etc. Their impacts on both the static and dynamic performances are also investigated with the aim of providing a guideline for conducting a reproducible thermal transient measurement for SiC MOSFETs.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-11-13T02:28:11",
        "content": "Compared with silicon (Si) power devices, Silicon carbide (SiC) devices have the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-resistance. However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs. All the parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the datasheet, which is practical in power electronics design.",

        "content": "In this work, the origin of the low free electron mobility in SiC MOSFETs is investigated using the scattering theory of two-dimensional electron gases. We first establish that neither phonon scattering nor Coulomb scattering can be the cause of the low observed mobility in SiC MOSFETs; we establish this fact by comparing the theoretically calculated mobility considering these effects with experimental observations. By considering the threshold voltages and the effective field dependence of the mobility in SiC MOSFETs, it is concluded that the scattering centers of the dominant mechanism are electrically neutral and exhibit a short-range scattering potential. By considering charge distribution around a neutral defect at the interface, it is established that an electric dipole induced by the defect can act as a short-range scattering potential. We then calculate the mobility in SiC MOSFETs assuming that there exist a high density of dipoles at the interface. The calculated dipole-scattering-limited mobility shows a similar dependence on the effective field dependence to that observed in experimental results. Thus, we conclude that scattering induced by a high density of electric dipoles at the interface is dominant cause of the low mobility in SiC MOSFETs.",

        "content": "This article studies the possibility of controlling the surge impedance of the electric motor in motor drives. The existing solution to suppress (or eliminate) the reflected wave impact on the motor insulation run by a Si-IGBT or SiC-MOSFET-based drive is to use either a sinewave filter or dv/dt filter. The alternative solution suggested in this article is to implement a high-bandwidth electronic circuit at the end of the cable or at the motor terminals to match the surge impedance of the cable and motor. The high-frequency voltage ringing due to the reflected waves in motor drives is around 1 MHz, depending on the cable parameters and the length of the cable. In the proposed method, the electronic circuit can quickly detect the dv/dt rise and fall edges and adjust the electronic circuit equivalent impedance when pulses arrive the motor terminals. Thus, the cable and motor surge impedances can be matched over a short time to prevent reflected waves. As a result, the leakage currents passing through the ball bearing and overvoltage stress on the motor insulation can be suppressed significantly.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-01-15T22:21:05",
        "content": "The reliability of power semiconductor switches is important when considering their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea applications. Respect to technology advancements in material sciences, power MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si) based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs. Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET, CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a real application such as downhole motor drives.",

        "content": "A liquid atmospheric pressure-matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (LAP-MALDI) method has been developed and applied to a commercial AP-MALDI source on a hybrid orbitrap mass analyzer. It is shown that electrospray ionization (ESI)-like mass spectra of a range of peptides and proteins can be acquired by LAP-MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) as previously demonstrated on a homemade LAP-MALDI-Q-TOF setup but without the need of any modification to the commercially available MS equipment used. Multiply charged peptide ions were recorded with a resolution of around 100,000 and a mass accuracy of less than 5 ppm. The higher resolution and mass accuracy of the orbitrap analyzer compared with previously employed Q-TOF instrumentation provided high confidence in bacterial proteoform and species identification by top-down protein analysis.",

        "publishedDate": "2021-07-22T00:35:44",
        "content": "Inter-terminal capacitances (ITCs) have major influence on the dynamic performance of power SiC MOSFETs. Knowledge of the exact values for the ITCs is required in order to perform accurate and predictive compact model simulations of their dynamic performance. Since commercial SiC MOSFETs are capable of operating in a wide range of temperatures, it is important to know the values of ITCs in the whole temperature range of operation. Direct measurements of the ITCs with standard equipment is possible only at low current levels (i.e. in the off-state (Vgs < Vth) for Vds > 0 V), however their values in the on-state (Vgs>Vth) also influence the MOSFETs switching performance. In this work, ITCs of a planar SiC MOSFET in the on-state are studied by the means of a calibrated TCAD model, revealing substantial temperature dependence in the range of 300-450 K. In the first approximation, this temperature dependence of the ITCs can be explained by a weaker temperature dependence of the MOSFET channel resistance in comparison to its JFET and epitaxial layer resistances. In addition, it is shown that at high frequencies stray inductances of the TO-247-3 package result in a change of the extracted values of the on-state ITCs. This effect is already notable at 1 MHz.",

        "title": "A Method for Treating Significant Conformational Changes in Alchemical Free Energy Simulations of Protein-Ligand Binding.",
        "content": "Relative binding free energy (RBFE) simulation is a rigorous approach to the calculation of quantitatively accurate binding free energy values for protein-ligand binding in which a reference binder is gradually converted to a target binder through alchemical transformation during the simulation. The success of such simulations relies on being able to accurately sample the correct conformational phase space for each alchemical state; however, this becomes a challenge when a significant conformation change occurs between the reference and target binder-receptor complexes. Increasing the simulation time and using enhanced sampling methods can be helpful, but effects can be limited, especially when the free energy barrier between conformations is high or when the correct target complex conformation is difficult to find and maintain. Current RBFE protocols seed the reference complex structure into every alchemical window of the simulation. In our study, we describe an improved protocol in which the reference structure is seeded into the first half of the alchemical windows, and the target structure is seeded into the second half of the alchemical windows. By applying information about the relevant correct end point conformations to different simulation windows from the beginning, the need for large barrier crossings or simulation prediction of the correct structures during an alchemical simulation is in many cases obviated. In the diverse cases we examine below, the simulations yielded free energy predictions that are satisfactory as compared to experiment and superior to running the simulations utilizing the conventional protocol. The method is straightforward to implement for publicly available FEP workflows.",

        "content": "In this paper, we investigated a gate driver using a GaN HEMT push-pull configuration for the high-frequency hard switching of a SiC power MOSFET. Low on-resistance and low input capacitance of GaN HEMTs are suitable for a high-frequency gate driver from the logic level, and robustness of SiC MOSFET with high avalanche capability is suitable for a valve transistor in power converters. Our proposed gate driver consists of digital isolators, complementary Si MOSFETs, and GaN HEMTs. The GaN HEMT push-pull stage has a high driving capability owing to its superior switching characteristics, and complementary Si MOSFETs can enhance the control signal from the digital isolator. We investigated limiting factors of the switching frequency of the proposed gate driver by focusing on each circuit component and proposed an improved driving configuration for the gate driver. As a result, 20-MHz hard switching of a SiC MOSFET was achieved using the improved gate driver with GaN HEMTs.",

        "content": "To explore the cortical microstructural alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) at different stages. 149 PD patients and 76 healthy controls were included. PD patients were divided into early stage PD (EPD) (Hoehn-Yahr stage ≤ 2) and moderate-to-late stage PD (MLPD) (Hoehn-Yahr stage ≥ 2.5) according to their Hoehn-Yahr stages. All participants underwent two-shell diffusion MRI and the images were fitted to Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) model to obtain the neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index (ODI) to reflect the cortical microstructure. We used gray matter-based spatial statistics method to compare the voxel-wise cortical NODDI metrics between groups. Partial correlation was used to correlate the NODDI metrics and global composite outcome in PD patients. Compared with healthy controls, EPD patients showed lower ODI in widespread regions, covering bilateral frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, as well as regional lower NDI in bilateral cingulate and frontal lobes. Compared with healthy controls, MLPD patients showed lower ODI and NDI in more widespread regions. Compared with EPD patients, MLPD patients showed lower ODI in bilateral temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, where the ODI values were negatively correlated with global composite outcome in PD patients. PD patients showed widespread cortical microstructural degeneration, characterized by reduced neurite density and orientation dispersion, and the cortical neuritic microstructure exhibit progressive degeneration during the progression of PD.",

        "content": "Thermal transient measurement based on source-drain voltage is a standard method to characterize thermal properties of silicon semiconductors but is doubtful to be directly applied to silicon carbide (SiC) devices. To evaluate its feasibility and limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive investigation into its accuracy, resolution, and stability towards yielding the structure information of SiC MOSFET using the source-drain voltage as the temperature sensitive electrical parameter. The whole characterization process involves two main procedures and associated key testing parameters, such as gate voltages, sensing and heating currents, etc. Their impacts on both the static and dynamic performances are also investigated with the aim of providing a guideline for conducting a reproducible thermal transient measurement for SiC MOSFETs.",

This study reports the occurrence and characterization of STEC from dairy cows and evaluates the inhibition of adherence by catlle anti-STEC antibodies to the HEp-2 cell. From 151 samples, 30% (n = 45) were positive for stx by PCR screening (25.21% of dairy cows and 46.8% of growing calves). From these positive samples, 17 STEC isolates were characterized. In dairy cows, 3 out of 17 samples carried stx2, 3 out of 17 possessed stx1, and 2 out of 17 carried stx1/stx2. In growing cows, 8 out of 17 samples carried stx1 and 1 out of 17 carried stx1/stx2. Other virulence factors such as ehxA, saa, iha, cah, and eae were detected. The strains were typed into 3 E. coli O groups (O26, O91, and O130). The analysis of the HEp-2 adherence assays indicated that all serum from both cattle categories presented high levels of inhibition of adherence. Considering the severity of the symptoms caused by STEC in humans, searching for factors influencing the colonization of STEC in cattle would help identify strategies to avoid transmission and STEC infection.",

        "content": "Compared with silicon (Si) power devices, Silicon carbide (SiC) devices have the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-resistance. However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs. All the parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the datasheet, which is practical in power electronics design.",

        "content": "In this work, the origin of the low free electron mobility in SiC MOSFETs is investigated using the scattering theory of two-dimensional electron gases. We first establish that neither phonon scattering nor Coulomb scattering can be the cause of the low observed mobility in SiC MOSFETs; we establish this fact by comparing the theoretically calculated mobility considering these effects with experimental observations. By considering the threshold voltages and the effective field dependence of the mobility in SiC MOSFETs, it is concluded that the scattering centers of the dominant mechanism are electrically neutral and exhibit a short-range scattering potential. By considering charge distribution around a neutral defect at the interface, it is established that an electric dipole induced by the defect can act as a short-range scattering potential. We then calculate the mobility in SiC MOSFETs assuming that there exist a high density of dipoles at the interface. The calculated dipole-scattering-limited mobility shows a similar dependence on the effective field dependence to that observed in experimental results. Thus, we conclude that scattering induced by a high density of electric dipoles at the interface is dominant cause of the low mobility in SiC MOSFETs.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-01-15T22:21:05",
        "content": "The reliability of power semiconductor switches is important when considering their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea applications. Respect to technology advancements in material sciences, power MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si) based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs. Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET, CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a real application such as downhole motor drives.",

This study describes the epidemiological investigations of outbreaks of LSD that occurred in 2022 in three Indian states viz., Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan and the genetic characterization of Lumpy skin disease viruses (LSDVs). Also, the population structure analysis of LSDVs was carried out. Out of 138 scab samples tested from suspected cattle for LSDV, 106 were found positive. Of these, nine representative scab samples were further genetically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis based on the P32 and EEV gene sequences depicted that the LSDV strains of the present study had nucleotide identity of 100% and 99.10-99.45%, respectively with the LSDV/2019 field strains of India. Multiple sequence alignment of the EEV glycoprotein gene sequences revealed nucleotide polymorphisms at three positions viz., G178A, G253A and A459G in circulating LSDV/2022 field strains. Based on the median joining network analysis of the EEV gene, 12 haplotypes were identified among the LSDV populations. Population structure analysis corresponding to the EEV gene revealed high haplotype (0.8486 ± 0.026) and low nucleotide diversities (0.00636 ± 0.0006) and negative values for neutrality indices, indicating a high number of closely related haplotypes and the studied population may have undergone a recent expansion. The findings will help in understanding the distribution and dynamics of LSDV populations, which will prove pivotal in designing and implementing effective management and control strategies.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-04-20T20:42:53",
        "content": "Fully-processed SiC power metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) emit light during switching of the gate terminal, while both drain and source terminals are grounded. The emitted photons are caused by defect-assisted recombination of electrons and holes at the 4H-SiC/SiO$_2$ interface and can be detected through the SiC substrate. Here, we present time-gated spectroscopic characterization of these interfacial point defects. Unlike in previous studies, the devices were opened in such a way that the drain-contact remained electrically active. A separate examination of the photons emitted at the rising and falling transitions of the gate-source voltage enabled the extraction of two different spectral components. One of these components consists of a single transition with phonon replicas of a local vibrational mode (LVM) with an astonishingly high energy of 220 meV $\\unicode{x2013}$ well above the highest phonon modes in 4H-SiC and SiO$_2$ of 120 meV and 137 meV, respectively. Based on a quantum mechanical model, we successfully fitted its emission spectrum and assigned it to donor-acceptor pair recombination involving a carbon cluster-like defect. Other transitions were assigned to EH$_{6/7}$-assisted, EK$_2$-D, and nitrogen-aluminum donor-acceptor pair recombination. Due to the relevance of these defects in the operation of SiC MOSFETs, these novel insights will contribute to improved reliability and performance of these devices.",

        "content": "Inter-terminal capacitances (ITCs) have major influence on the dynamic performance of power SiC MOSFETs. Knowledge of the exact values for the ITCs is required in order to perform accurate and predictive compact model simulations of their dynamic performance. Since commercial SiC MOSFETs are capable of operating in a wide range of temperatures, it is important to know the values of ITCs in the whole temperature range of operation. Direct measurements of the ITCs with standard equipment is possible only at low current levels (i.e. in the off-state (Vgs < Vth) for Vds > 0 V), however their values in the on-state (Vgs>Vth) also influence the MOSFETs switching performance. In this work, ITCs of a planar SiC MOSFET in the on-state are studied by the means of a calibrated TCAD model, revealing substantial temperature dependence in the range of 300-450 K. In the first approximation, this temperature dependence of the ITCs can be explained by a weaker temperature dependence of the MOSFET channel resistance in comparison to its JFET and epitaxial layer resistances. In addition, it is shown that at high frequencies stray inductances of the TO-247-3 package result in a change of the extracted values of the on-state ITCs. This effect is already notable at 1 MHz.",

Low on-resistance and low input capacitance of GaN HEMTs are suitable for a high-frequency gate driver from the logic level, and robustness of SiC MOSFET with high avalanche capability is suitable for a valve transistor in power converters. Our proposed gate driver consists of digital isolators, complementary Si MOSFETs, and GaN HEMTs. The GaN HEMT push-pull stage has a high driving capability owing to its superior switching characteristics, and complementary Si MOSFETs can enhance the control signal from the digital isolator. We investigated limiting factors of the switching frequency of the proposed gate driver by focusing on each circuit component and proposed an improved driving configuration for the gate driver. As a result, 20-MHz hard switching of a SiC MOSFET was achieved using the improved gate driver with GaN HEMTs.",

Plasmonic nanoparticles have emerged as a tool for confining light on nanometer-length scales where regions of intense electromagnetic fields can be precisely tuned for controlled surface chemistry. We demonstrate a precision pH-driven synthesis of gold nanorods with optical resonance properties widely tunable across the near-infrared spectrum. Through controlled electrostatic interactions, we can perform selective adsorbate molecule attachment and monitor the surface transitions through spectroscopic techniques that include ground-state absorption spectrophotometry, two-dimensional X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. We elucidate the electronic, structural, and chemical factors that contribute to plasmon-molecule dynamics at the nanoscale with broad implications for the fields of energy, photonics, and bio-inspired materials.",

        "content": "The origin of dielectric breakdown was studied on 4H-SiC MOSFETs that failed after three months of high temperature reverse bias (HTRB) stress. A local inspection of the failed devices demonstrated the presence of a threading dislocation (TD) at the breakdown location. The nanoscale origin of the dielectric breakdown was highlighted with advanced high-spatial-resolution scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques. In particular, SPM revealed the conductive nature of the TD and a local increase of the minority carrier concentration close to the defect. Numerical simulations estimated a hole concentration 13 orders of magnitude larger than in the ideal 4H-SiC crystal. The hole injection in specific regions of the device explained the failure of the gate oxide under stress. In this way, the key role of the TD in the dielectric breakdown of 4H-SiC MOSFET was unambiguously demonstrated.",

The present paper reports the green synthesis of CuO NPs and B-doped CuO NPs (B-CuO NPs) from Livistona chinensis leaf extract. Not much work has been reported on the use of the plant extract for the fabrication of NPs, particularly those of Cu and its doped counterparts. Various spectroscopic techniques were used to characterize the synthesized NPs. In the FT-IR spectra, peaks obtained at 504 cm-1 to 600 cm-1 were due to Cu-O vibrations. The energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) spectra confirmed the CuO NPs' composition and B's presence inside the NPs. The peak pattern in X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum confirmed the crystalline and monoclinic phases of the NPs. The average crystalline size of CuO NPs and B-CuO NPs was 19.56 nm and 17.30 nm respectively. The CuO and B-CuO NPs were tested against three Gram-positive bacterial strains namely Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus and three Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Salmonella abony, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa through Agar well diffusion method and it was found that CuO NPs showed higher activity than B-CuO NPs.",

        "content": "The development of hydrophobic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels, which are typically hydrophilic, could significantly enhance their application as artificial extracellular matrices. In this study, we designed PEG hydrogels with enhanced hydrophobicity through gel-gel phase separation (GGPS), a phenomenon that uniquely enhances hydrophobicity under ambient conditions, and we elucidated the pivotal role of elasticity in this process. We hypothesized that increased elasticity would amplify GGPS, thereby improving the hydrophobicity and cell adhesion on PEG hydrogel surfaces, despite their inherent hydrophilicity. To test this hypothesis, we engineered dilute oligo-PEG gels via a two-step process, creating polymer networks from tetra-PEG clusters with multiple reaction points. These oligo-PEG gels exhibited significantly higher elasticity, turbidity, and shrinkage upon water immersion compared to dilute PEG gels. Detailed characterization through confocal laser scanning microscopy, rheological measurements, and cell adhesion assays revealed distinct biphasic structures, increased hydrophobicity, and enhanced cell attachability in the dilute oligo-PEG gels. Our findings confirm that elasticity is crucial for effective GGPS, providing a novel method for tailoring hydrogel properties without chemical modification. This research introduces a new paradigm for designing biomaterials with improved cell-scaffolding capabilities, offering significant potential for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

        "publishedDate": "2022-10-13T23:45:37",
        "content": "Ulta-wide bandgap semiconductors based on $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ offer the potential to achieve higher power switching performance, efficiency, and lower manufacturing cost than today's wide bandgap power semiconductors. However, the most critical challenge to the commercialization of Ga$_2$O$_3$ electronics is overheating, which impacts the device's performance and reliability. We fabricated a Ga$_2$O$_3$/4H-SiC composite wafer using a fusion-bonding method. A low temperature ($\\le$ 600 $^{\\circ}$C) epitaxy and device processing approach based on low-temperature (LT) metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy is developed to grow a Ga$_2$O$_3$ epitaxial channel layer on the composite wafer and subsequently fabricate into Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs. This LT approach is essential to preserve the structural integrity of the composite wafer. These LT-grown epitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSFETs deliver high thermal performance (56% reduction in channel temperature), high voltage blocking capabilities up to 2.45 kV, and power figures of merit of $\\sim$ 300 MW/cm$^2$, which is a record high for any heterogeneously integrated Ga$_2$O$_3$ devices reported to date. This work is the first realization of multi-kilovolt homoepitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs fabricated on a composite substrate with high heat transfer performance which delivers state-of-the-art power density values while running much cooler than those on native substrates. Thermal characterization and modeling results reveal that a Ga$_2$O$_3$/diamond composite wafer with a reduced Ga$_2$O$_3$ thickness ($\\sim$ 1 $\\mu$m) and thinner bonding interlayer ($<$ 10 nm) can reduce the device thermal impedance to a level lower than today's GaN-on-SiC power switches.",

SiC-based power electronics are being looked at as a strong alternative for high power spaceborne power electronic systems. The SiC MOSFET has been shown to be most prone to SEB of the radiation effects. The knowledge of SiC MOSFET device degradation and failure mechanisms are reviewed. Additionally, the viability of rad-tolerant SiC MOSFET designs and the methods of SEB simulation are evaluated. A merit system is proposed to consider the performance of radiation tolerance and nominal electrical performance. Criteria needed for high-fidelity SEB simulation are also reviewed.

A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.",

        "content": "Renewable energy source such as photovoltaic (PV) cell generates power from the sun light by converting solar power to electrical power with no moving parts and less maintenance. A single photovoltaic cell produces voltage of low level. In order to boost up the voltage, a DC-DC boost converter is used. In order to use this DC-DC converter for high voltage and high frequency applications, Silicon Carbide (SiC) device is most preferred because of larger current carrying capability, higher voltage blocking capability, high operating temperature and less static and dynamic losses than the traditional silicon (Si) power switches. In the proposed work, the static and dynamic characteristics of SiC MOSFET for different temperatures are observed. A SiC MOSFET based boost converter is investigated which is powered by PV source. This DC - DC converter is controlled using a Pulse-Width Method (PWM) and the duty cycle d is calculated for tracking the maximum power point using incremental conductance algorithm of the PV systems implemented in FPGA. Simulation studies are carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK.A prototype of the SiC converter is built and the results are verified experimentally. The performance parameters of the proposed converter such as output voltage ripple input current ripple and losses are computed and it is compared with the classical silicon (Si) MOSFET converter.",

To evaluate its feasibility and limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive investigation into its accuracy, resolution, and stability towards yielding the structure information of SiC MOSFET using the source-drain voltage as the temperature sensitive electrical parameter. The whole characterization process involves two main procedures and associated key testing parameters, such as gate voltages, sensing and heating currents, etc. Their impacts on both the static and dynamic performances are also investigated with the aim of providing a guideline for conducting a reproducible thermal transient measurement for SiC MOSFETs.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-11-13T02:28:11",
        "content": "Compared with silicon (Si) power devices, Silicon carbide (SiC) devices have the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-resistance. However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs. All the parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the datasheet, which is practical in power electronics design.",

        "content": "In this work, the origin of the low free electron mobility in SiC MOSFETs is investigated using the scattering theory of two-dimensional electron gases. We first establish that neither phonon scattering nor Coulomb scattering can be the cause of the low observed mobility in SiC MOSFETs; we establish this fact by comparing the theoretically calculated mobility considering these effects with experimental observations. By considering the threshold voltages and the effective field dependence of the mobility in SiC MOSFETs, it is concluded that the scattering centers of the dominant mechanism are electrically neutral and exhibit a short-range scattering potential. By considering charge distribution around a neutral defect at the interface, it is established that an electric dipole induced by the defect can act as a short-range scattering potential. We then calculate the mobility in SiC MOSFETs assuming that there exist a high density of dipoles at the interface. The calculated dipole-scattering-limited mobility shows a similar dependence on the effective field dependence to that observed in experimental results. Thus, we conclude that scattering induced by a high density of electric dipoles at the interface is dominant cause of the low mobility in SiC MOSFETs.",

        "content": "This article studies the possibility of controlling the surge impedance of the electric motor in motor drives. The existing solution to suppress (or eliminate) the reflected wave impact on the motor insulation run by a Si-IGBT or SiC-MOSFET-based drive is to use either a sinewave filter or dv/dt filter. The alternative solution suggested in this article is to implement a high-bandwidth electronic circuit at the end of the cable or at the motor terminals to match the surge impedance of the cable and motor. The high-frequency voltage ringing due to the reflected waves in motor drives is around 1 MHz, depending on the cable parameters and the length of the cable. In the proposed method, the electronic circuit can quickly detect the dv/dt rise and fall edges and adjust the electronic circuit equivalent impedance when pulses arrive the motor terminals. Thus, the cable and motor surge impedances can be matched over a short time to prevent reflected waves. As a result, the leakage currents passing through the ball bearing and overvoltage stress on the motor insulation can be suppressed significantly.",

        "content": "A liquid atmospheric pressure-matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (LAP-MALDI) method has been developed and applied to a commercial AP-MALDI source on a hybrid orbitrap mass analyzer. It is shown that electrospray ionization (ESI)-like mass spectra of a range of peptides and proteins can be acquired by LAP-MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) as previously demonstrated on a homemade LAP-MALDI-Q-TOF setup but without the need of any modification to the commercially available MS equipment used. Multiply charged peptide ions were recorded with a resolution of around 100,000 and a mass accuracy of less than 5 ppm. The higher resolution and mass accuracy of the orbitrap analyzer compared with previously employed Q-TOF instrumentation provided high confidence in bacterial proteoform and species identification by top-down protein analysis.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-01-15T22:21:05",
        "content": "The reliability of power semiconductor switches is important when considering their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea applications. Respect to technology advancements in material sciences, power MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si) based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs. Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET, CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a real application such as downhole motor drives.",

        "title": "A Method for Treating Significant Conformational Changes in Alchemical Free Energy Simulations of Protein-Ligand Binding.",
        "content": "Relative binding free energy (RBFE) simulation is a rigorous approach to the calculation of quantitatively accurate binding free energy values for protein-ligand binding in which a reference binder is gradually converted to a target binder through alchemical transformation during the simulation. The success of such simulations relies on being able to accurately sample the correct conformational phase space for each alchemical state; however, this becomes a challenge when a significant conformation change occurs between the reference and target binder-receptor complexes. Increasing the simulation time and using enhanced sampling methods can be helpful, but effects can be limited, especially when the free energy barrier between conformations is high or when the correct target complex conformation is difficult to find and maintain. Current RBFE protocols seed the reference complex structure into every alchemical window of the simulation. In our study, we describe an improved protocol in which the reference structure is seeded into the first half of the alchemical windows, and the target structure is seeded into the second half of the alchemical windows. By applying information about the relevant correct end point conformations to different simulation windows from the beginning, the need for large barrier crossings or simulation prediction of the correct structures during an alchemical simulation is in many cases obviated. In the diverse cases we examine below, the simulations yielded free energy predictions that are satisfactory as compared to experiment and superior to running the simulations utilizing the conventional protocol. The method is straightforward to implement for publicly available FEP workflows.",

        "publishedDate": "2021-07-22T00:35:44",
        "content": "Inter-terminal capacitances (ITCs) have major influence on the dynamic performance of power SiC MOSFETs. Knowledge of the exact values for the ITCs is required in order to perform accurate and predictive compact model simulations of their dynamic performance. Since commercial SiC MOSFETs are capable of operating in a wide range of temperatures, it is important to know the values of ITCs in the whole temperature range of operation. Direct measurements of the ITCs with standard equipment is possible only at low current levels (i.e. in the off-state (Vgs < Vth) for Vds > 0 V), however their values in the on-state (Vgs>Vth) also influence the MOSFETs switching performance. In this work, ITCs of a planar SiC MOSFET in the on-state are studied by the means of a calibrated TCAD model, revealing substantial temperature dependence in the range of 300-450 K. In the first approximation, this temperature dependence of the ITCs can be explained by a weaker temperature dependence of the MOSFET channel resistance in comparison to its JFET and epitaxial layer resistances. In addition, it is shown that at high frequencies stray inductances of the TO-247-3 package result in a change of the extracted values of the on-state ITCs. This effect is already notable at 1 MHz.",

        "content": "To explore the cortical microstructural alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) at different stages. 149 PD patients and 76 healthy controls were included. PD patients were divided into early stage PD (EPD) (Hoehn-Yahr stage ≤ 2) and moderate-to-late stage PD (MLPD) (Hoehn-Yahr stage ≥ 2.5) according to their Hoehn-Yahr stages. All participants underwent two-shell diffusion MRI and the images were fitted to Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) model to obtain the neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index (ODI) to reflect the cortical microstructure. We used gray matter-based spatial statistics method to compare the voxel-wise cortical NODDI metrics between groups. Partial correlation was used to correlate the NODDI metrics and global composite outcome in PD patients. Compared with healthy controls, EPD patients showed lower ODI in widespread regions, covering bilateral frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, as well as regional lower NDI in bilateral cingulate and frontal lobes. Compared with healthy controls, MLPD patients showed lower ODI and NDI in more widespread regions. Compared with EPD patients, MLPD patients showed lower ODI in bilateral temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, where the ODI values were negatively correlated with global composite outcome in PD patients. PD patients showed widespread cortical microstructural degeneration, characterized by reduced neurite density and orientation dispersion, and the cortical neuritic microstructure exhibit progressive degeneration during the progression of PD.",

Low on-resistance and low input capacitance of GaN HEMTs are suitable for a high-frequency gate driver from the logic level, and robustness of SiC MOSFET with high avalanche capability is suitable for a valve transistor in power converters. Our proposed gate driver consists of digital isolators, complementary Si MOSFETs, and GaN HEMTs. The GaN HEMT push-pull stage has a high driving capability owing to its superior switching characteristics, and complementary Si MOSFETs can enhance the control signal from the digital isolator. We investigated limiting factors of the switching frequency of the proposed gate driver by focusing on each circuit component and proposed an improved driving configuration for the gate driver. As a result, 20-MHz hard switching of a SiC MOSFET was achieved using the improved gate driver with GaN HEMTs.",

To evaluate its feasibility and limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive investigation into its accuracy, resolution, and stability towards yielding the structure information of SiC MOSFET using the source-drain voltage as the temperature sensitive electrical parameter. The whole characterization process involves two main procedures and associated key testing parameters, such as gate voltages, sensing and heating currents, etc. Their impacts on both the static and dynamic performances are also investigated with the aim of providing a guideline for conducting a reproducible thermal transient measurement for SiC MOSFETs.",

        "content": "Compared with silicon (Si) power devices, Silicon carbide (SiC) devices have the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-resistance. However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs. All the parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the datasheet, which is practical in power electronics design.",

This study reports the occurrence and characterization of STEC from dairy cows and evaluates the inhibition of adherence by catlle anti-STEC antibodies to the HEp-2 cell. From 151 samples, 30% (n = 45) were positive for stx by PCR screening (25.21% of dairy cows and 46.8% of growing calves). From these positive samples, 17 STEC isolates were characterized. In dairy cows, 3 out of 17 samples carried stx2, 3 out of 17 possessed stx1, and 2 out of 17 carried stx1/stx2. In growing cows, 8 out of 17 samples carried stx1 and 1 out of 17 carried stx1/stx2. Other virulence factors such as ehxA, saa, iha, cah, and eae were detected. The strains were typed into 3 E. coli O groups (O26, O91, and O130). The analysis of the HEp-2 adherence assays indicated that all serum from both cattle categories presented high levels of inhibition of adherence. Considering the severity of the symptoms caused by STEC in humans, searching for factors influencing the colonization of STEC in cattle would help identify strategies to avoid transmission and STEC infection.",

        "content": "In this work, the origin of the low free electron mobility in SiC MOSFETs is investigated using the scattering theory of two-dimensional electron gases. We first establish that neither phonon scattering nor Coulomb scattering can be the cause of the low observed mobility in SiC MOSFETs; we establish this fact by comparing the theoretically calculated mobility considering these effects with experimental observations. By considering the threshold voltages and the effective field dependence of the mobility in SiC MOSFETs, it is concluded that the scattering centers of the dominant mechanism are electrically neutral and exhibit a short-range scattering potential. By considering charge distribution around a neutral defect at the interface, it is established that an electric dipole induced by the defect can act as a short-range scattering potential. We then calculate the mobility in SiC MOSFETs assuming that there exist a high density of dipoles at the interface. The calculated dipole-scattering-limited mobility shows a similar dependence on the effective field dependence to that observed in experimental results. Thus, we conclude that scattering induced by a high density of electric dipoles at the interface is dominant cause of the low mobility in SiC MOSFETs.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-01-15T22:21:05",
        "content": "The reliability of power semiconductor switches is important when considering their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea applications. Respect to technology advancements in material sciences, power MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si) based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs. Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET, CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a real application such as downhole motor drives.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-04-20T20:42:53",
        "content": "Fully-processed SiC power metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) emit light during switching of the gate terminal, while both drain and source terminals are grounded. The emitted photons are caused by defect-assisted recombination of electrons and holes at the 4H-SiC/SiO$_2$ interface and can be detected through the SiC substrate. Here, we present time-gated spectroscopic characterization of these interfacial point defects. Unlike in previous studies, the devices were opened in such a way that the drain-contact remained electrically active. A separate examination of the photons emitted at the rising and falling transitions of the gate-source voltage enabled the extraction of two different spectral components. One of these components consists of a single transition with phonon replicas of a local vibrational mode (LVM) with an astonishingly high energy of 220 meV $\\unicode{x2013}$ well above the highest phonon modes in 4H-SiC and SiO$_2$ of 120 meV and 137 meV, respectively. Based on a quantum mechanical model, we successfully fitted its emission spectrum and assigned it to donor-acceptor pair recombination involving a carbon cluster-like defect. Other transitions were assigned to EH$_{6/7}$-assisted, EK$_2$-D, and nitrogen-aluminum donor-acceptor pair recombination. Due to the relevance of these defects in the operation of SiC MOSFETs, these novel insights will contribute to improved reliability and performance of these devices.",

        "content": "Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a transboundary, viral disease of cattle with a significant economic impact on the livestock industry. This study describes the epidemiological investigations of outbreaks of LSD that occurred in 2022 in three Indian states viz., Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan and the genetic characterization of Lumpy skin disease viruses (LSDVs). Also, the population structure analysis of LSDVs was carried out. Out of 138 scab samples tested from suspected cattle for LSDV, 106 were found positive. Of these, nine representative scab samples were further genetically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis based on the P32 and EEV gene sequences depicted that the LSDV strains of the present study had nucleotide identity of 100% and 99.10-99.45%, respectively with the LSDV/2019 field strains of India. Multiple sequence alignment of the EEV glycoprotein gene sequences revealed nucleotide polymorphisms at three positions viz., G178A, G253A and A459G in circulating LSDV/2022 field strains. Based on the median joining network analysis of the EEV gene, 12 haplotypes were identified among the LSDV populations. Population structure analysis corresponding to the EEV gene revealed high haplotype (0.8486 ± 0.026) and low nucleotide diversities (0.00636 ± 0.0006) and negative values for neutrality indices, indicating a high number of closely related haplotypes and the studied population may have undergone a recent expansion. The findings will help in understanding the distribution and dynamics of LSDV populations, which will prove pivotal in designing and implementing effective management and control strategies.",

        "content": "Inter-terminal capacitances (ITCs) have major influence on the dynamic performance of power SiC MOSFETs. Knowledge of the exact values for the ITCs is required in order to perform accurate and predictive compact model simulations of their dynamic performance. Since commercial SiC MOSFETs are capable of operating in a wide range of temperatures, it is important to know the values of ITCs in the whole temperature range of operation. Direct measurements of the ITCs with standard equipment is possible only at low current levels (i.e. in the off-state (Vgs < Vth) for Vds > 0 V), however their values in the on-state (Vgs>Vth) also influence the MOSFETs switching performance. In this work, ITCs of a planar SiC MOSFET in the on-state are studied by the means of a calibrated TCAD model, revealing substantial temperature dependence in the range of 300-450 K. In the first approximation, this temperature dependence of the ITCs can be explained by a weaker temperature dependence of the MOSFET channel resistance in comparison to its JFET and epitaxial layer resistances. In addition, it is shown that at high frequencies stray inductances of the TO-247-3 package result in a change of the extracted values of the on-state ITCs. This effect is already notable at 1 MHz.",

        "content": "In this paper, we investigated a gate driver using a GaN HEMT push-pull configuration for the high-frequency hard switching of a SiC power MOSFET. Low on-resistance and low input capacitance of GaN HEMTs are suitable for a high-frequency gate driver from the logic level, and robustness of SiC MOSFET with high avalanche capability is suitable for a valve transistor in power converters. Our proposed gate driver consists of digital isolators, complementary Si MOSFETs, and GaN HEMTs. The GaN HEMT push-pull stage has a high driving capability owing to its superior switching characteristics, and complementary Si MOSFETs can enhance the control signal from the digital isolator. We investigated limiting factors of the switching frequency of the proposed gate driver by focusing on each circuit component and proposed an improved driving configuration for the gate driver. As a result, 20-MHz hard switching of a SiC MOSFET was achieved using the improved gate driver with GaN HEMTs.",

        "content": "The formacion of numerous unpredictable DNA Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) on chromosomes iniciates meiotic recombination. In this perspective, we propose a 'multi-key lock' model to secure the risky but necesary breaks as well as a 'one per pair of cromatids' model for the topoisomerase-like early recombinosome. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes recombine at few sites of crossing-overs (COs) to ensure correct segregation. The initiation of meiotic recombination involves the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) during prophase I. Too many DSBs are dangerous for genome integrity: if these DSBs are not properly repaired, it could potentially lead to chromosomal fragmentation. Too few DSBs are also problematic: if the obligate CO cannot form between bivalents, catastrophic unequal segregation of univalents lead to the formation of sterile aneuploid spores. Research on the regulation of the formation of these necessary but risky DSBs has recently advanced in yeast, mammals and plants. DNA DSBs are created by the enzymatic activity of the early recombinosome, a topoisomerase-like complex containing SPO11. This opinion paper reviews recent insights on the regulation of the SPO11 cofactors necessary for the introduction of temporally and spatially controlled DSBs. We propose that a 'multi-key-lock' model for each subunit of the early recombinosome complex is required to secure the formation of DSBs. We also discuss the hypothetical implications that the established topoisomerase-like nature of the SPO11 core-complex can have in creating DSB in only one of the two replicated chromatids of early prophase I meiotic chromosomes. This hypothetical 'one per pair of chromatids' DSB formation model could optimize the faithful repair of the self-inflicted DSBs. Each DSB could use three potential intact homologous DNA sequences as repair template: one from the sister chromatid and the two others from the homologous chromosomes.",

        "content": "The origin of dielectric breakdown was studied on 4H-SiC MOSFETs that failed after three months of high temperature reverse bias (HTRB) stress. A local inspection of the failed devices demonstrated the presence of a threading dislocation (TD) at the breakdown location. The nanoscale origin of the dielectric breakdown was highlighted with advanced high-spatial-resolution scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques. In particular, SPM revealed the conductive nature of the TD and a local increase of the minority carrier concentration close to the defect. Numerical simulations estimated a hole concentration 13 orders of magnitude larger than in the ideal 4H-SiC crystal. The hole injection in specific regions of the device explained the failure of the gate oxide under stress. In this way, the key role of the TD in the dielectric breakdown of 4H-SiC MOSFET was unambiguously demonstrated.",

        "publishedDate": "2022-10-13T23:45:37",
        "content": "Ulta-wide bandgap semiconductors based on $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ offer the potential to achieve higher power switching performance, efficiency, and lower manufacturing cost than today's wide bandgap power semiconductors. However, the most critical challenge to the commercialization of Ga$_2$O$_3$ electronics is overheating, which impacts the device's performance and reliability. We fabricated a Ga$_2$O$_3$/4H-SiC composite wafer using a fusion-bonding method. A low temperature ($\\le$ 600 $^{\\circ}$C) epitaxy and device processing approach based on low-temperature (LT) metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy is developed to grow a Ga$_2$O$_3$ epitaxial channel layer on the composite wafer and subsequently fabricate into Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs. This LT approach is essential to preserve the structural integrity of the composite wafer. These LT-grown epitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSFETs deliver high thermal performance (56% reduction in channel temperature), high voltage blocking capabilities up to 2.45 kV, and power figures of merit of $\\sim$ 300 MW/cm$^2$, which is a record high for any heterogeneously integrated Ga$_2$O$_3$ devices reported to date. This work is the first realization of multi-kilovolt homoepitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs fabricated on a composite substrate with high heat transfer performance which delivers state-of-the-art power density values while running much cooler than those on native substrates. Thermal characterization and modeling results reveal that a Ga$_2$O$_3$/diamond composite wafer with a reduced Ga$_2$O$_3$ thickness ($\\sim$ 1 $\\mu$m) and thinner bonding interlayer ($<$ 10 nm) can reduce the device thermal impedance to a level lower than today's GaN-on-SiC power switches.",

To evaluate its feasibility and limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive investigation into its accuracy, resolution, and stability towards yielding the structure information of SiC MOSFET using the source-drain voltage as the temperature sensitive electrical parameter. The whole characterization process involves two main procedures and associated key testing parameters, such as gate voltages, sensing and heating currents, etc. Their impacts on both the static and dynamic performances are also investigated with the aim of providing a guideline for conducting a reproducible thermal transient measurement for SiC MOSFETs.",

A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.",

Additionally, the viability of rad-tolerant SiC MOSFET designs and the methods of SEB simulation are evaluated. A merit system is proposed to consider the performance of radiation tolerance and nominal electrical performance. Criteria needed for high-fidelity SEB simulation are also reviewed.

        "content": "Renewable energy source such as photovoltaic (PV) cell generates power from the sun light by converting solar power to electrical power with no moving parts and less maintenance. A single photovoltaic cell produces voltage of low level. In order to boost up the voltage, a DC-DC boost converter is used. In order to use this DC-DC converter for high voltage and high frequency applications, Silicon Carbide (SiC) device is most preferred because of larger current carrying capability, higher voltage blocking capability, high operating temperature and less static and dynamic losses than the traditional silicon (Si) power switches. In the proposed work, the static and dynamic characteristics of SiC MOSFET for different temperatures are observed. A SiC MOSFET based boost converter is investigated which is powered by PV source. This DC - DC converter is controlled using a Pulse-Width Method (PWM) and the duty cycle d is calculated for tracking the maximum power point using incremental conductance algorithm of the PV systems implemented in FPGA. Simulation studies are carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK.A prototype of the SiC converter is built and the results are verified experimentally. The performance parameters of the proposed converter such as output voltage ripple input current ripple and losses are computed and it is compared with the classical silicon (Si) MOSFET converter.",

        "publishedDate": "2022-10-13T23:45:37",
        "content": "Ulta-wide bandgap semiconductors based on $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ offer the potential to achieve higher power switching performance, efficiency, and lower manufacturing cost than today's wide bandgap power semiconductors. However, the most critical challenge to the commercialization of Ga$_2$O$_3$ electronics is overheating, which impacts the device's performance and reliability. We fabricated a Ga$_2$O$_3$/4H-SiC composite wafer using a fusion-bonding method. A low temperature ($\\le$ 600 $^{\\circ}$C) epitaxy and device processing approach based on low-temperature (LT) metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy is developed to grow a Ga$_2$O$_3$ epitaxial channel layer on the composite wafer and subsequently fabricate into Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs. This LT approach is essential to preserve the structural integrity of the composite wafer. These LT-grown epitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSFETs deliver high thermal performance (56% reduction in channel temperature), high voltage blocking capabilities up to 2.45 kV, and power figures of merit of $\\sim$ 300 MW/cm$^2$, which is a record high for any heterogeneously integrated Ga$_2$O$_3$ devices reported to date. This work is the first realization of multi-kilovolt homoepitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs fabricated on a composite substrate with high heat transfer performance which delivers state-of-the-art power density values while running much cooler than those on native substrates. Thermal characterization and modeling results reveal that a Ga$_2$O$_3$/diamond composite wafer with a reduced Ga$_2$O$_3$ thickness ($\\sim$ 1 $\\mu$m) and thinner bonding interlayer ($<$ 10 nm) can reduce the device thermal impedance to a level lower than today's GaN-on-SiC power switches.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-11-13T02:28:11",
        "content": "Compared with silicon (Si) power devices, Silicon carbide (SiC) devices have the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-resistance. However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs. All the parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the datasheet, which is practical in power electronics design.",

        "content": "In this work, the origin of the low free electron mobility in SiC MOSFETs is investigated using the scattering theory of two-dimensional electron gases. We first establish that neither phonon scattering nor Coulomb scattering can be the cause of the low observed mobility in SiC MOSFETs; we establish this fact by comparing the theoretically calculated mobility considering these effects with experimental observations. By considering the threshold voltages and the effective field dependence of the mobility in SiC MOSFETs, it is concluded that the scattering centers of the dominant mechanism are electrically neutral and exhibit a short-range scattering potential. By considering charge distribution around a neutral defect at the interface, it is established that an electric dipole induced by the defect can act as a short-range scattering potential. We then calculate the mobility in SiC MOSFETs assuming that there exist a high density of dipoles at the interface. The calculated dipole-scattering-limited mobility shows a similar dependence on the effective field dependence to that observed in experimental results. Thus, we conclude that scattering induced by a high density of electric dipoles at the interface is dominant cause of the low mobility in SiC MOSFETs.",

        "content": "This article studies the possibility of controlling the surge impedance of the electric motor in motor drives. The existing solution to suppress (or eliminate) the reflected wave impact on the motor insulation run by a Si-IGBT or SiC-MOSFET-based drive is to use either a sinewave filter or dv/dt filter. The alternative solution suggested in this article is to implement a high-bandwidth electronic circuit at the end of the cable or at the motor terminals to match the surge impedance of the cable and motor. The high-frequency voltage ringing due to the reflected waves in motor drives is around 1 MHz, depending on the cable parameters and the length of the cable. In the proposed method, the electronic circuit can quickly detect the dv/dt rise and fall edges and adjust the electronic circuit equivalent impedance when pulses arrive the motor terminals. Thus, the cable and motor surge impedances can be matched over a short time to prevent reflected waves. As a result, the leakage currents passing through the ball bearing and overvoltage stress on the motor insulation can be suppressed significantly.",

        "content": "A liquid atmospheric pressure-matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (LAP-MALDI) method has been developed and applied to a commercial AP-MALDI source on a hybrid orbitrap mass analyzer. It is shown that electrospray ionization (ESI)-like mass spectra of a range of peptides and proteins can be acquired by LAP-MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) as previously demonstrated on a homemade LAP-MALDI-Q-TOF setup but without the need of any modification to the commercially available MS equipment used. Multiply charged peptide ions were recorded with a resolution of around 100,000 and a mass accuracy of less than 5 ppm. The higher resolution and mass accuracy of the orbitrap analyzer compared with previously employed Q-TOF instrumentation provided high confidence in bacterial proteoform and species identification by top-down protein analysis.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-01-15T22:21:05",
        "content": "The reliability of power semiconductor switches is important when considering their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea applications. Respect to technology advancements in material sciences, power MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si) based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs. Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET, CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a real application such as downhole motor drives.",

        "title": "A Method for Treating Significant Conformational Changes in Alchemical Free Energy Simulations of Protein-Ligand Binding.",
        "content": "Relative binding free energy (RBFE) simulation is a rigorous approach to the calculation of quantitatively accurate binding free energy values for protein-ligand binding in which a reference binder is gradually converted to a target binder through alchemical transformation during the simulation. The success of such simulations relies on being able to accurately sample the correct conformational phase space for each alchemical state; however, this becomes a challenge when a significant conformation change occurs between the reference and target binder-receptor complexes. Increasing the simulation time and using enhanced sampling methods can be helpful, but effects can be limited, especially when the free energy barrier between conformations is high or when the correct target complex conformation is difficult to find and maintain. Current RBFE protocols seed the reference complex structure into every alchemical window of the simulation. In our study, we describe an improved protocol in which the reference structure is seeded into the first half of the alchemical windows, and the target structure is seeded into the second half of the alchemical windows. By applying information about the relevant correct end point conformations to different simulation windows from the beginning, the need for large barrier crossings or simulation prediction of the correct structures during an alchemical simulation is in many cases obviated. In the diverse cases we examine below, the simulations yielded free energy predictions that are satisfactory as compared to experiment and superior to running the simulations utilizing the conventional protocol. The method is straightforward to implement for publicly available FEP workflows.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-04-20T20:42:53",
        "content": "Fully-processed SiC power metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) emit light during switching of the gate terminal, while both drain and source terminals are grounded. The emitted photons are caused by defect-assisted recombination of electrons and holes at the 4H-SiC/SiO$_2$ interface and can be detected through the SiC substrate. Here, we present time-gated spectroscopic characterization of these interfacial point defects. Unlike in previous studies, the devices were opened in such a way that the drain-contact remained electrically active. A separate examination of the photons emitted at the rising and falling transitions of the gate-source voltage enabled the extraction of two different spectral components. One of these components consists of a single transition with phonon replicas of a local vibrational mode (LVM) with an astonishingly high energy of 220 meV $\\unicode{x2013}$ well above the highest phonon modes in 4H-SiC and SiO$_2$ of 120 meV and 137 meV, respectively. Based on a quantum mechanical model, we successfully fitted its emission spectrum and assigned it to donor-acceptor pair recombination involving a carbon cluster-like defect. Other transitions were assigned to EH$_{6/7}$-assisted, EK$_2$-D, and nitrogen-aluminum donor-acceptor pair recombination. Due to the relevance of these defects in the operation of SiC MOSFETs, these novel insights will contribute to improved reliability and performance of these devices.",

        "content": "This was a prospective, interventional, comparative study conducted on patients with congenital simple severe ptosis. A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.",

        "content": "Many real world tasks require multiple agents to work together. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been proposed in recent years to solve these tasks, but current methods often fail to efficiently learn policies. We thus investigate the presence of a common weakness in single-agent RL, namely value function overestimation bias, in the multi-agent setting. Based on our findings, we propose an approach that reduces this bias by using double centralized critics. We evaluate it on six mixed cooperative-competitive tasks, showing a significant advantage over current methods. Finally, we investigate the application of multi-agent methods to high-dimensional robotic tasks and show that our approach can be used to learn decentralized policies in this domain.",

Training of the deep Q-network (DQN) is usually restricted to first order gradient based methods. This paper attempts to accelerate the training of deep Q-networks by introducing a second order Nesterov's accelerated quasi-Newton method. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on deep reinforcement learning using double DQNs for global routing. The results show that the proposed method can obtain better routing solutions compared to the DQNs trained with first order Adam and RMSprop methods.",

The method's resolution makes multidimensional coherent spectroscopy relevant for atomic systems that have narrow resonances. We use double-quantum multidimensional coherent spectroscopy to reveal collective hyperfine resonances in rubidium vapor at 100 C induced by dipole-dipole interactions. We observe tilted lineshapes in the double-quantum 2D spectra, which has never been reported for Doppler-broadened systems. The tilted lineshapes suggest that the signal is predominately from the interacting atoms that have near zero relative velocity.",

It is shown that electrospray ionization (ESI)-like mass spectra of a range of peptides and proteins can be acquired by LAP-MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) as previously demonstrated on a homemade LAP-MALDI-Q-TOF setup but without the need of any modification to the commercially available MS equipment used. Multiply charged peptide ions were recorded with a resolution of around 100,000 and a mass accuracy of less than 5 ppm.

All networks are trained in an unsupervised manner, leaving room for scalability.

        "title": "A Method for Treating Significant Conformational Changes in Alchemical Free Energy Simulations of Protein-Ligand Binding.",
        "content": "Relative binding free energy (RBFE) simulation is a rigorous approach to the calculation of quantitatively accurate binding free energy values for protein-ligand binding in which a reference binder is gradually converted to a target binder through alchemical transformation during the simulation. The success of such simulations relies on being able to accurately sample the correct conformational phase space for each alchemical state; however, this becomes a challenge when a significant conformation change occurs between the reference and target binder-receptor complexes. Increasing the simulation time and using enhanced sampling methods can be helpful, but effects can be limited, especially when the free energy barrier between conformations is high or when the correct target complex conformation is difficult to find and maintain. Current RBFE protocols seed the reference complex structure into every alchemical window of the simulation. In our study, we describe an improved protocol in which the reference structure is seeded into the first half of the alchemical windows, and the target structure is seeded into the second half of the alchemical windows. By applying information about the relevant correct end point conformations to different simulation windows from the beginning, the need for large barrier crossings or simulation prediction of the correct structures during an alchemical simulation is in many cases obviated. In the diverse cases we examine below, the simulations yielded free energy predictions that are satisfactory as compared to experiment and superior to running the simulations utilizing the conventional protocol. The method is straightforward to implement for publicly available FEP workflows.",

        "content": "To explore the cortical microstructural alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) at different stages. 149 PD patients and 76 healthy controls were included. PD patients were divided into early stage PD (EPD) (Hoehn-Yahr stage ≤ 2) and moderate-to-late stage PD (MLPD) (Hoehn-Yahr stage ≥ 2.5) according to their Hoehn-Yahr stages. All participants underwent two-shell diffusion MRI and the images were fitted to Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) model to obtain the neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index (ODI) to reflect the cortical microstructure. We used gray matter-based spatial statistics method to compare the voxel-wise cortical NODDI metrics between groups. Partial correlation was used to correlate the NODDI metrics and global composite outcome in PD patients. Compared with healthy controls, EPD patients showed lower ODI in widespread regions, covering bilateral frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, as well as regional lower NDI in bilateral cingulate and frontal lobes. Compared with healthy controls, MLPD patients showed lower ODI and NDI in more widespread regions. Compared with EPD patients, MLPD patients showed lower ODI in bilateral temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, where the ODI values were negatively correlated with global composite outcome in PD patients. PD patients showed widespread cortical microstructural degeneration, characterized by reduced neurite density and orientation dispersion, and the cortical neuritic microstructure exhibit progressive degeneration during the progression of PD.",

The crystal undergoes second harmonic generation with type II phase matching. The study of standard KTP crystal using the DSMP technique helps to validate the efficiency of this technique. We were able to extract the crystal's double Mueller matrix, the relative contribution of the susceptibility tensor components, the phase difference between the susceptibility tensor components, etc. We could determine the crystal axes orientation using this optical technique, which was not possible through a single crystal X-Ray diffraction technique for such a large size crystal for which both optic axes and crystallographic axes are the same. Axes direction determined from polarization microscope measurements and Laue diffraction measurements on KTP crystal is compared with those obtained from DSMP measurements.",

        "content": "Hyperuniform many-particle systems are characterized by a structure factor $S({\\mathbf{k}})$ that is precisely zero as $|\\mathbf{k}|\\rightarrow0$; and stealthy hyperuniform systems have $S({\\mathbf{k}})=0$ for the finite range $0 < |{\\mathbf{k}}| \\le K$, called the \"exclusion region.\" Through a process of collective-coordinate optimization, energy-minimizing disordered stealthy hyperuniform systems of moderate size have been made to high accuracy, and their novel physical properties have shown great promise. However, minimizing $S(\\mathbf{k})$ in the exclusion region is computationally intensive as the system size becomes large. In this Letter, we present an improved methodology to generate such states using double-double precision calculations on GPUs that reduces the deviations from zero within the exclusion region by a factor of approximately $10^{30}$ for systems sizes more than an order of magnitude larger. We further show that this ultra-high accuracy is required to draw conclusions about their corresponding characteristics, such as the nature of the associated energy landscape and the presence or absence of Anderson localization, which might be masked, even when deviations are relatively small.",

        "content": "We discuss the ultimate precision bounds on the multiparameter estimation of single- and two-mode pure Gaussian states. By leveraging on previous approaches that focused on the estimation of a complex displacement only, we derive the Holevo Cram\\'er-Rao bound (HCRB) for both displacement and squeezing parameter characterizing single and two-mode squeezed states. In the single-mode scenario, we obtain an analytical bound and find that it degrades monotonically as the squeezing increases. Furthermore, we prove that heterodyne detection is nearly optimal in the large squeezing limit, but in general the optimal measurement must include non-Gaussian resources. On the other hand, in the two-mode setting, the HCRB improves as the squeezing parameter grows and we show that it can be attained using double-homodyne detection.",

This study reports the occurrence and characterization of STEC from dairy cows and evaluates the inhibition of adherence by catlle anti-STEC antibodies to the HEp-2 cell. From 151 samples, 30% (n = 45) were positive for stx by PCR screening (25.21% of dairy cows and 46.8% of growing calves). From these positive samples, 17 STEC isolates were characterized. In dairy cows, 3 out of 17 samples carried stx2, 3 out of 17 possessed stx1, and 2 out of 17 carried stx1/stx2. In growing cows, 8 out of 17 samples carried stx1 and 1 out of 17 carried stx1/stx2. Other virulence factors such as ehxA, saa, iha, cah, and eae were detected. The strains were typed into 3 E. coli O groups (O26, O91, and O130). The analysis of the HEp-2 adherence assays indicated that all serum from both cattle categories presented high levels of inhibition of adherence. Considering the severity of the symptoms caused by STEC in humans, searching for factors influencing the colonization of STEC in cattle would help identify strategies to avoid transmission and STEC infection.",

        "content": "In this paper, we mainly study left invariant pseudo-Riemannian Ricci-parallel metrics on connected Lie groups which are not Einstein. Following a result of Boubel and B\\'{e}rard Bergery, there are two typical types of such metrics, which are characterized by the minimal polynomial of the Ricci operator. Namely, its form is either $(X-\\alpha)(X-\\bar{\\alpha})$ (type I), where $\\alpha\\in \\mathbb{C}\\setminus \\mathbb{R}$, or $X^{2}$ (type II). Firstly, we obtain a complete description of Ricci-parallel metrics of type I. In particular, such a Ricci-parallel metric is uniquely determined by an Einstein metric and an invariant symmetric parallel complex structure up to isometry and scaling. Then we study Ricci-parallel metric Lie algebras of type II by using double extension process. Surprisingly, we find that every double extension of a metric Abelian Lie algebra is Ricci-parallel and the converse holds for Lorentz Ricci-parallel metric nilpotent Lie algebras of type II. Moreover, we construct infinitely many new explicit examples of Ricci-parallel metric Lie algebras which are not Einstein.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-09-15T16:51:23",
        "content": "Compact neutron imagers using double-scatter kinematic reconstruction are being designed for localization and characterization of special nuclear material. These neutron imaging systems rely on scintillators with a rapid prompt temporal response as the detection medium. As n-p elastic scattering is the primary mechanism for light generation by fast neutron interactions in organic scintillators, proton light yield data are needed for accurate assessment of scintillator performance. The proton light yield of a series of commercial fast plastic organic scintillators---EJ-200, EJ-204, and EJ-208---was measured via a double time-of-flight technique at the 88-Inch Cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Using a tunable deuteron breakup neutron source, target scintillators housed in a dual photomultiplier tube configuration, and an array of pulse-shape-discriminating observation scintillators, the fast plastic scintillator light yield was measured over a broad and continuous energy range down to proton recoil energies of approximately 50 keV. This work provides key input to event reconstruction algorithms required for utilization of these materials in emerging neutron imaging modalities.",

With sharp contrast, we prove that $\\mathfrak{M}^{\\infty,\\mathrm{dec}}(G)\\not=\\mathrm{B}(G)$ for some class of non-discrete locally compact groups and that $\\mathfrak{M}^{\\infty,\\mathrm{dec}}(G)=\\mathrm{B}(G)$ for any (second countable unimodular) inner amenable locally compact group. To prove these results, we connect to groupoid theory and to the problem of the existence of a contractive projection preserving complete positivity from the space of normal completely bounded operators on $\\mathrm{VN}(G)$ onto the space $\\mathfrak{M}^{\\infty,\\mathrm{cb}}(G)$ of completely bounded Fourier multipliers, that we solve affirmatively in the inner amenable case. In addition, we are able to show that such projections does not exist for (second countable) non-amenable connected locally compact groups. Indeed, we examine more generally if the space $\\mathfrak{M}^{p,\\mathrm{cb}}(G)$ of completely bounded Fourier multipliers on the noncommutative $\\mathrm{L}^p$-space $\\mathrm{L}^p(\\mathrm{VN}(G))$ is complemented in the space of completely bounded operators, where $1 \\leq p \\leq \\infty$. Using doubling metrics on Lie groups and structure theory from the solution to Hilbert's fifth problem, we establish that any (second countable unimodular) finite-dimensional amenable locally compact group admits compatible bounded projections at level $p=1$ and $p=\\infty$. Finally, we also state a related new characterization of amenability for (second countable unimodular) locally compact groups and we also give applications to decomposable (=regular) multipliers.",

This study describes the epidemiological investigations of outbreaks of LSD that occurred in 2022 in three Indian states viz., Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan and the genetic characterization of Lumpy skin disease viruses (LSDVs). Also, the population structure analysis of LSDVs was carried out. Out of 138 scab samples tested from suspected cattle for LSDV, 106 were found positive. Of these, nine representative scab samples were further genetically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis based on the P32 and EEV gene sequences depicted that the LSDV strains of the present study had nucleotide identity of 100% and 99.10-99.45%, respectively with the LSDV/2019 field strains of India. Multiple sequence alignment of the EEV glycoprotein gene sequences revealed nucleotide polymorphisms at three positions viz., G178A, G253A and A459G in circulating LSDV/2022 field strains. Based on the median joining network analysis of the EEV gene, 12 haplotypes were identified among the LSDV populations. Population structure analysis corresponding to the EEV gene revealed high haplotype (0.8486 ± 0.026) and low nucleotide diversities (0.00636 ± 0.0006) and negative values for neutrality indices, indicating a high number of closely related haplotypes and the studied population may have undergone a recent expansion. The findings will help in understanding the distribution and dynamics of LSDV populations, which will prove pivotal in designing and implementing effective management and control strategies.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-02-07T21:23:33",
        "content": "Category theory unifies mathematical concepts, aiding comparisons across structures by incorporating objects and morphisms, which capture their interactions. It has influenced areas of computer science such as automata theory, functional programming, and semantics. Certain objects naturally exhibit two classes of morphisms, leading to the concept of a double category, which has found applications in computing science (e.g., ornaments, profunctor optics, denotational semantics). The emergence of diverse categorical structures motivated a unified framework for category theory. However, unlike other mathematical objects, classification of categorical structures faces challenges due to various relevant equivalences. This poses significant challenges when pursuing the formalization of categories and restricts the applicability of powerful techniques, such as transport along equivalences. This work contends that univalent foundations offers a suitable framework for classifying different categorical structures based on desired notions of equivalences, and remedy the challenges when formalizing categories. The richer notion of equality in univalent foundations makes the equivalence of a categorical structure an inherent part of its structure. We concretely apply this analysis to double categorical structures. We characterize and formalize various definitions in Coq UniMath, including (pseudo) double categories and double bicategories, up to chosen equivalences. We also establish univalence principles, making chosen equivalences part of the double categorical structure, analyzing strict double setcategories (invariant under isomorphisms), pseudo double setcategories (invariant under isomorphisms), univalent pseudo double categories (invariant under vertical equivalences) and univalent double bicategories (invariant under gregarious equivalences).",

The helium is isolated from the external bath with the exception of two pin-holes of cross section about 10% that of the channel. We measure the temperatures of both the heater strip and the channel helium during slow-pulse heating that reaches peak power after 9 ms, fast-pulse heating that reaches peak power after 100 $\\mu$s, and step heating that reaches steady power after 100 $\\mu$s. Using the steady state Kapitza heat transfer expression at the interface between heater and helium, and the Gorter-Mellink heat transfer regime in the helium channel, we obtain excellent agreement between simulation and measurement during the first 5 ms of slow-pulse tests. Using instead the measured helium temperature in the Kapitza expression, we obtain excellent agreement between the simulated and measured heater response during the first 150 ms of slow-pulse tests. The same model fails to explain the fast-pulse transient response of the heater and helium, while it can explain the helium response to a step in applied power but not the heater response. The steady state Kapitza expression may therefore not be applicable to heating events that are over within a single millisecond.",

        "content": "The formacion of numerous unpredictable DNA Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) on chromosomes iniciates meiotic recombination. In this perspective, we propose a 'multi-key lock' model to secure the risky but necesary breaks as well as a 'one per pair of cromatids' model for the topoisomerase-like early recombinosome. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes recombine at few sites of crossing-overs (COs) to ensure correct segregation. The initiation of meiotic recombination involves the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) during prophase I. Too many DSBs are dangerous for genome integrity: if these DSBs are not properly repaired, it could potentially lead to chromosomal fragmentation. Too few DSBs are also problematic: if the obligate CO cannot form between bivalents, catastrophic unequal segregation of univalents lead to the formation of sterile aneuploid spores. Research on the regulation of the formation of these necessary but risky DSBs has recently advanced in yeast, mammals and plants. DNA DSBs are created by the enzymatic activity of the early recombinosome, a topoisomerase-like complex containing SPO11. This opinion paper reviews recent insights on the regulation of the SPO11 cofactors necessary for the introduction of temporally and spatially controlled DSBs. We propose that a 'multi-key-lock' model for each subunit of the early recombinosome complex is required to secure the formation of DSBs. We also discuss the hypothetical implications that the established topoisomerase-like nature of the SPO11 core-complex can have in creating DSB in only one of the two replicated chromatids of early prophase I meiotic chromosomes. This hypothetical 'one per pair of chromatids' DSB formation model could optimize the faithful repair of the self-inflicted DSBs. Each DSB could use three potential intact homologous DNA sequences as repair template: one from the sister chromatid and the two others from the homologous chromosomes.",

        "content": "We examined the effect of backside insulation on the dynamic on-resistance of lateral p-GaN HEMTs. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic onresistance difference between substrate grounded and substrate floating p-GaN HEMTs, we conducted in-circuit double pulse testing and long-term direct current (DC) bias stress. We have realized that while backside insulation can enhance the breakdown voltage of lateral p-GaN HEMTs, it also comes with a tradeoff in device reliability. Results through Sentaurus TCAD simulation suggest that the use of backside insulation in devices gradually disperses potential to the buffer barrier. As a result, the potential barrier at the buffer edge of the 2DEG channel decreases significantly, leading to considerable electron trappings at buffer traps. This breakdown voltage and reliability tradeoff also applies to HEMT technologies using insulating substrates.",

        "content": "Effective methods for characterizing the noise in quantum computing devices are essential for programming and debugging circuit performance. Existing approaches vary in the information obtained as well as the amount of quantum and classical resources required, with more information generally requiring more resources. Here we benchmark the characterization methods of gate set tomography, Pauli channel noise reconstruction, and empirical direct characterization for developing models that describe noisy quantum circuit performance on a 27-qubit superconducting transmon device. We evaluate these models by comparing the accuracy of noisy circuit simulations with the corresponding experimental observations. We find that the agreement of noise model to experiment does not correlate with the information gained by characterization and that the underlying circuit strongly influences the best choice of characterization approach. Empirical direct characterization scales best of the methods we tested and produced the most accurate characterizations across our benchmarks.",

        "content": "This was a prospective, interventional, comparative study conducted on patients with congenital simple severe ptosis. A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.",

        "publishedDate": "2022-03-09T13:24:28",
        "content": "We explore transient heat transfer, on the millisecond time-scale, from a narrow, rectangular stainless steel heater cooled from one side by He II confined to a channel of 120 $\\mu$m depth. The helium is isolated from the external bath with the exception of two pin-holes of cross section about 10% that of the channel. We measure the temperatures of both the heater strip and the channel helium during slow-pulse heating that reaches peak power after 9 ms, fast-pulse heating that reaches peak power after 100 $\\mu$s, and step heating that reaches steady power after 100 $\\mu$s. Using the steady state Kapitza heat transfer expression at the interface between heater and helium, and the Gorter-Mellink heat transfer regime in the helium channel, we obtain excellent agreement between simulation and measurement during the first 5 ms of slow-pulse tests. Using instead the measured helium temperature in the Kapitza expression, we obtain excellent agreement between the simulated and measured heater response during the first 150 ms of slow-pulse tests. The same model fails to explain the fast-pulse transient response of the heater and helium, while it can explain the helium response to a step in applied power but not the heater response. The steady state Kapitza expression may therefore not be applicable to heating events that are over within a single millisecond.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-06-08T15:58:55",
        "content": "Fabrication imperfections must be considered during configuration to ensure that the setup is suitable for the actual fabricated programmable photonic integrated circuits (PPICs). Therefore, characterization of imperfections is crucial but difficult, especially for PPICs made from recirculating waveguide meshes. The flexibility required by these meshes demands a more complex topology and compact TBU structure, complicating the characterization. In this paper, we propose a characterization method applicable to recirculating waveguide meshes based on an optimization approach, along with a step-by-step procedure to reduce the parameter space of optimization, allowing for characterizing imperfect parameters of each individual component within the waveguide mesh. To the best of our knowledge, this method can greatly broaden the range of characterized parameters compared to currently reported methods. In order to verify the effectiveness of our method, we used the characterized parameters to build a multi-frequency model of a mesh with fabrication errors and successfully demonstrated accurate prediction of its behavior. Furthermore, we applied our method on implementations of 6 different kind of FIR/IRR filters, to further prove the effectiveness of our method in configuring applications on meshes with fabrication errors. At last, our method was carried out under various scenarios considering beam splitter splitting ratio variance, inaccurate measurements of mesh and imprecise TBU insertion loss characterization, to demonstrate its strong robustness under various practical scenarios.",

        "content": "The accurate and reliable description of measurement devices is a central problem in both observing uniquely non-classical behaviors and realizing quantum technologies from powerful computing to precision metrology. To date quantum tomography is the prevalent tool to characterize quantum detectors. However, such a characterization relies on accurately characterized probe states, rendering reliability of the characterization lost in circular argument. Here we report a self-characterization method of quantum measurements based on reconstructing the response range, the entirety of attainable measurement outcomes, eliminating the reliance on known states. We characterize two representative measurements implemented with photonic setups and obtain fidelities above 99.99% with the conventional tomographic reconstructions. This initiates range-based techniques in characterizing quantum systems and foreshadows novel device-independent protocols of quantum information applications.",

        "content": "Experimental science is enabled by the combination of synthesis, imaging, and functional characterization. Synthesis of a new material is typically followed by a set of characterization methods aiming to provide feedback for optimization or discover fundamental mechanisms. However, the sequence of synthesis and characterization methods and their interpretation, or research workflow, has traditionally been driven by human intuition and is highly domain specific. Here we explore concepts of scientific workflows that emerge at the interface between theory, characterization, and imaging. We discuss the criteria by which these workflows can be constructed for special cases of multi-resolution structural imaging and structural and functional characterization. Some considerations for theory-experiment workflows are provided. We further pose that the emergence of user facilities and cloud labs disrupt the classical progression from ideation, orchestration, and execution stages of workflow development and necessitate development of universal frameworks for workflow design, including universal hyper-languages describing laboratory operation, reward functions and their integration between domains, and policy development for workflow optimization. These tools will enable knowledge-based workflow optimization, enable lateral instrumental networks, sequential and parallel orchestration of characterization between dissimilar facilities, and empower distributed research.",

However, current data characterization methods are largely focused on classification settings, with regression settings largely understudied. To address this, we introduce TRIAGE, a novel data characterization framework tailored to regression tasks and compatible with a broad class of regressors. TRIAGE utilizes conformal predictive distributions to provide a model-agnostic scoring method, the TRIAGE score. We operationalize the score to analyze individual samples' training dynamics and characterize samples as under-, over-, or well-estimated by the model. We show that TRIAGE's characterization is consistent and highlight its utility to improve performance via data sculpting/filtering, in multiple regression settings. Additionally, beyond sample level, we show TRIAGE enables new approaches to dataset selection and feature acquisition. Overall, TRIAGE highlights the value unlocked by data characterization in real-world regression applications",

        "content": "Characterization of noise in current near-term quantum devices is of paramount importance to fully use their computational power. However, direct quantum process tomography becomes unfeasible for systems composed of tens of qubits. A promising alternative method based on tensor networks was recently proposed [Nat. Commun. 14, 2858 (2023)]. In this paper, we adapt it for the characterization of noise channels on near-term quantum computers and investigate its performance thoroughly. In particular, we show how experimentally feasible tomographic samples are sufficient to accurately characterize realistic correlated noise models affecting individual layers of quantum circuits, and study its performance on systems composed of up to 20 qubits. Furthermore, we combine this noise characterization method with a recently proposed noise-aware tensor network error mitigation protocol for correcting outcomes in noisy circuits, resulting accurate estimations even on deep circuit instances. This positions the tensor-network-based noise characterization protocol as a valuable tool for practical error characterization and mitigation in the near-term quantum computing era.",

        "content": "A liquid atmospheric pressure-matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (LAP-MALDI) method has been developed and applied to a commercial AP-MALDI source on a hybrid orbitrap mass analyzer. It is shown that electrospray ionization (ESI)-like mass spectra of a range of peptides and proteins can be acquired by LAP-MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) as previously demonstrated on a homemade LAP-MALDI-Q-TOF setup but without the need of any modification to the commercially available MS equipment used. Multiply charged peptide ions were recorded with a resolution of around 100,000 and a mass accuracy of less than 5 ppm. The higher resolution and mass accuracy of the orbitrap analyzer compared with previously employed Q-TOF instrumentation provided high confidence in bacterial proteoform and species identification by top-down protein analysis.",

        "title": "A Method for Treating Significant Conformational Changes in Alchemical Free Energy Simulations of Protein-Ligand Binding.",
        "content": "Relative binding free energy (RBFE) simulation is a rigorous approach to the calculation of quantitatively accurate binding free energy values for protein-ligand binding in which a reference binder is gradually converted to a target binder through alchemical transformation during the simulation. The success of such simulations relies on being able to accurately sample the correct conformational phase space for each alchemical state; however, this becomes a challenge when a significant conformation change occurs between the reference and target binder-receptor complexes. Increasing the simulation time and using enhanced sampling methods can be helpful, but effects can be limited, especially when the free energy barrier between conformations is high or when the correct target complex conformation is difficult to find and maintain. Current RBFE protocols seed the reference complex structure into every alchemical window of the simulation. In our study, we describe an improved protocol in which the reference structure is seeded into the first half of the alchemical windows, and the target structure is seeded into the second half of the alchemical windows. By applying information about the relevant correct end point conformations to different simulation windows from the beginning, the need for large barrier crossings or simulation prediction of the correct structures during an alchemical simulation is in many cases obviated. In the diverse cases we examine below, the simulations yielded free energy predictions that are satisfactory as compared to experiment and superior to running the simulations utilizing the conventional protocol. The method is straightforward to implement for publicly available FEP workflows.",

A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.",

        "content": "Compact neutron imagers using double-scatter kinematic reconstruction are being designed for localization and characterization of special nuclear material. These neutron imaging systems rely on scintillators with a rapid prompt temporal response as the detection medium. As n-p elastic scattering is the primary mechanism for light generation by fast neutron interactions in organic scintillators, proton light yield data are needed for accurate assessment of scintillator performance. The proton light yield of a series of commercial fast plastic organic scintillators---EJ-200, EJ-204, and EJ-208---was measured via a double time-of-flight technique at the 88-Inch Cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Using a tunable deuteron breakup neutron source, target scintillators housed in a dual photomultiplier tube configuration, and an array of pulse-shape-discriminating observation scintillators, the fast plastic scintillator light yield was measured over a broad and continuous energy range down to proton recoil energies of approximately 50 keV. This work provides key input to event reconstruction algorithms required for utilization of these materials in emerging neutron imaging modalities.",

        "content": "Many real world tasks require multiple agents to work together. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been proposed in recent years to solve these tasks, but current methods often fail to efficiently learn policies. We thus investigate the presence of a common weakness in single-agent RL, namely value function overestimation bias, in the multi-agent setting. Based on our findings, we propose an approach that reduces this bias by using double centralized critics. We evaluate it on six mixed cooperative-competitive tasks, showing a significant advantage over current methods. Finally, we investigate the application of multi-agent methods to high-dimensional robotic tasks and show that our approach can be used to learn decentralized policies in this domain.",

Training of the deep Q-network (DQN) is usually restricted to first order gradient based methods.

        "content": "A liquid atmospheric pressure-matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (LAP-MALDI) method has been developed and applied to a commercial AP-MALDI source on a hybrid orbitrap mass analyzer. It is shown that electrospray ionization (ESI)-like mass spectra of a range of peptides and proteins can be acquired by LAP-MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) as previously demonstrated on a homemade LAP-MALDI-Q-TOF setup but without the need of any modification to the commercially available MS equipment used. Multiply charged peptide ions were recorded with a resolution of around 100,000 and a mass accuracy of less than 5 ppm. The higher resolution and mass accuracy of the orbitrap analyzer compared with previously employed Q-TOF instrumentation provided high confidence in bacterial proteoform and species identification by top-down protein analysis.",

        "content": "Frequency comb based multidimensional coherent spectroscopy is a novel optical method that enables high resolution measurement in a short acquisition time. The method's resolution makes multidimensional coherent spectroscopy relevant for atomic systems that have narrow resonances. We use double-quantum multidimensional coherent spectroscopy to reveal collective hyperfine resonances in rubidium vapor at 100 C induced by dipole-dipole interactions. We observe tilted lineshapes in the double-quantum 2D spectra, which has never been reported for Doppler-broadened systems. The tilted lineshapes suggest that the signal is predominately from the interacting atoms that have near zero relative velocity.",

        "title": "A Method for Treating Significant Conformational Changes in Alchemical Free Energy Simulations of Protein-Ligand Binding.",
        "content": "Relative binding free energy (RBFE) simulation is a rigorous approach to the calculation of quantitatively accurate binding free energy values for protein-ligand binding in which a reference binder is gradually converted to a target binder through alchemical transformation during the simulation. The success of such simulations relies on being able to accurately sample the correct conformational phase space for each alchemical state; however, this becomes a challenge when a significant conformation change occurs between the reference and target binder-receptor complexes. Increasing the simulation time and using enhanced sampling methods can be helpful, but effects can be limited, especially when the free energy barrier between conformations is high or when the correct target complex conformation is difficult to find and maintain. Current RBFE protocols seed the reference complex structure into every alchemical window of the simulation. In our study, we describe an improved protocol in which the reference structure is seeded into the first half of the alchemical windows, and the target structure is seeded into the second half of the alchemical windows. By applying information about the relevant correct end point conformations to different simulation windows from the beginning, the need for large barrier crossings or simulation prediction of the correct structures during an alchemical simulation is in many cases obviated. In the diverse cases we examine below, the simulations yielded free energy predictions that are satisfactory as compared to experiment and superior to running the simulations utilizing the conventional protocol. The method is straightforward to implement for publicly available FEP workflows.",

Taking a step towards closing this gap, we propose two unsupervised training frameworks for finding a common representation of LiDAR and camera data. The first method utilizes a double Siamese training structure to ensure consistency in the results. The second method uses a Canny edge image guiding the networks towards a desired representation. All networks are trained in an unsupervised manner, leaving room for scalability. The results are evaluated using common computer vision applications, and the limitations of the proposed approaches are outlined.",

        "content": "Radiation hardening of the MOSFET is of the highest priority for sustaining high-power systems in the space radiation environment. SiC-based power electronics are being looked at as a strong alternative for high power spaceborne power electronic systems. The SiC MOSFET has been shown to be most prone to SEB of the radiation effects. The knowledge of SiC MOSFET device degradation and failure mechanisms are reviewed. Additionally, the viability of rad-tolerant SiC MOSFET designs and the methods of SEB simulation are evaluated. A merit system is proposed to consider the performance of radiation tolerance and nominal electrical performance. Criteria needed for high-fidelity SEB simulation are also reviewed. This paper stands as a necessary analytical review to intercede the development of rad-hard power devices for space and extreme environment applications.",

        "content": "This was a prospective, interventional, comparative study conducted on patients with congenital simple severe ptosis. A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.",

        "content": "Renewable energy source such as photovoltaic (PV) cell generates power from the sun light by converting solar power to electrical power with no moving parts and less maintenance. A single photovoltaic cell produces voltage of low level. In order to boost up the voltage, a DC-DC boost converter is used. In order to use this DC-DC converter for high voltage and high frequency applications, Silicon Carbide (SiC) device is most preferred because of larger current carrying capability, higher voltage blocking capability, high operating temperature and less static and dynamic losses than the traditional silicon (Si) power switches. In the proposed work, the static and dynamic characteristics of SiC MOSFET for different temperatures are observed. A SiC MOSFET based boost converter is investigated which is powered by PV source. This DC - DC converter is controlled using a Pulse-Width Method (PWM) and the duty cycle d is calculated for tracking the maximum power point using incremental conductance algorithm of the PV systems implemented in FPGA. Simulation studies are carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK.A prototype of the SiC converter is built and the results are verified experimentally. The performance parameters of the proposed converter such as output voltage ripple input current ripple and losses are computed and it is compared with the classical silicon (Si) MOSFET converter.",

To evaluate its feasibility and limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive investigation into its accuracy, resolution, and stability towards yielding the structure information of SiC MOSFET using the source-drain voltage as the temperature sensitive electrical parameter. The whole characterization process involves two main procedures and associated key testing parameters, such as gate voltages, sensing and heating currents, etc. Their impacts on both the static and dynamic performances are also investigated with the aim of providing a guideline for conducting a reproducible thermal transient measurement for SiC MOSFETs.",

        "content": "Compared with silicon (Si) power devices, Silicon carbide (SiC) devices have the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-resistance. However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs. All the parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the datasheet, which is practical in power electronics design.",

        "content": "In this work, the origin of the low free electron mobility in SiC MOSFETs is investigated using the scattering theory of two-dimensional electron gases. We first establish that neither phonon scattering nor Coulomb scattering can be the cause of the low observed mobility in SiC MOSFETs; we establish this fact by comparing the theoretically calculated mobility considering these effects with experimental observations. By considering the threshold voltages and the effective field dependence of the mobility in SiC MOSFETs, it is concluded that the scattering centers of the dominant mechanism are electrically neutral and exhibit a short-range scattering potential. By considering charge distribution around a neutral defect at the interface, it is established that an electric dipole induced by the defect can act as a short-range scattering potential. We then calculate the mobility in SiC MOSFETs assuming that there exist a high density of dipoles at the interface. The calculated dipole-scattering-limited mobility shows a similar dependence on the effective field dependence to that observed in experimental results. Thus, we conclude that scattering induced by a high density of electric dipoles at the interface is dominant cause of the low mobility in SiC MOSFETs.",

        "publishedDate": "2022-12-26T16:40:55",
        "content": "This article studies the possibility of controlling the surge impedance of the electric motor in motor drives. The existing solution to suppress (or eliminate) the reflected wave impact on the motor insulation run by a Si-IGBT or SiC-MOSFET-based drive is to use either a sinewave filter or dv/dt filter. The alternative solution suggested in this article is to implement a high-bandwidth electronic circuit at the end of the cable or at the motor terminals to match the surge impedance of the cable and motor. The high-frequency voltage ringing due to the reflected waves in motor drives is around 1 MHz, depending on the cable parameters and the length of the cable. In the proposed method, the electronic circuit can quickly detect the dv/dt rise and fall edges and adjust the electronic circuit equivalent impedance when pulses arrive the motor terminals. Thus, the cable and motor surge impedances can be matched over a short time to prevent reflected waves. As a result, the leakage currents passing through the ball bearing and overvoltage stress on the motor insulation can be suppressed significantly.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-01-15T22:21:05",
        "content": "The reliability of power semiconductor switches is important when considering their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea applications. Respect to technology advancements in material sciences, power MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si) based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs. Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET, CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a real application such as downhole motor drives.",

        "content": "Relative binding free energy (RBFE) simulation is a rigorous approach to the calculation of quantitatively accurate binding free energy values for protein-ligand binding in which a reference binder is gradually converted to a target binder through alchemical transformation during the simulation. The success of such simulations relies on being able to accurately sample the correct conformational phase space for each alchemical state; however, this becomes a challenge when a significant conformation change occurs between the reference and target binder-receptor complexes. Increasing the simulation time and using enhanced sampling methods can be helpful, but effects can be limited, especially when the free energy barrier between conformations is high or when the correct target complex conformation is difficult to find and maintain. Current RBFE protocols seed the reference complex structure into every alchemical window of the simulation. In our study, we describe an improved protocol in which the reference structure is seeded into the first half of the alchemical windows, and the target structure is seeded into the second half of the alchemical windows. By applying information about the relevant correct end point conformations to different simulation windows from the beginning, the need for large barrier crossings or simulation prediction of the correct structures during an alchemical simulation is in many cases obviated. In the diverse cases we examine below, the simulations yielded free energy predictions that are satisfactory as compared to experiment and superior to running the simulations utilizing the conventional protocol. The method is straightforward to implement for publicly available FEP workflows.",

        "publishedDate": "2021-07-22T00:35:44",
        "content": "Inter-terminal capacitances (ITCs) have major influence on the dynamic performance of power SiC MOSFETs. Knowledge of the exact values for the ITCs is required in order to perform accurate and predictive compact model simulations of their dynamic performance. Since commercial SiC MOSFETs are capable of operating in a wide range of temperatures, it is important to know the values of ITCs in the whole temperature range of operation. Direct measurements of the ITCs with standard equipment is possible only at low current levels (i.e. in the off-state (Vgs < Vth) for Vds > 0 V), however their values in the on-state (Vgs>Vth) also influence the MOSFETs switching performance. In this work, ITCs of a planar SiC MOSFET in the on-state are studied by the means of a calibrated TCAD model, revealing substantial temperature dependence in the range of 300-450 K. In the first approximation, this temperature dependence of the ITCs can be explained by a weaker temperature dependence of the MOSFET channel resistance in comparison to its JFET and epitaxial layer resistances. In addition, it is shown that at high frequencies stray inductances of the TO-247-3 package result in a change of the extracted values of the on-state ITCs. This effect is already notable at 1 MHz.",

PD patients were divided into early stage PD (EPD) (Hoehn-Yahr stage ≤ 2) and moderate-to-late stage PD (MLPD) (Hoehn-Yahr stage ≥ 2.5) according to their Hoehn-Yahr stages. All participants underwent two-shell diffusion MRI and the images were fitted to Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) model to obtain the neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index (ODI) to reflect the cortical microstructure. We used gray matter-based spatial statistics method to compare the voxel-wise cortical NODDI metrics between groups. Partial correlation was used to correlate the NODDI metrics and global composite outcome in PD patients. Compared with healthy controls, EPD patients showed lower ODI in widespread regions, covering bilateral frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, as well as regional lower NDI in bilateral cingulate and frontal lobes. Compared with healthy controls, MLPD patients showed lower ODI and NDI in more widespread regions. Compared with EPD patients, MLPD patients showed lower ODI in bilateral temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, where the ODI values were negatively correlated with global composite outcome in PD patients.

Low on-resistance and low input capacitance of GaN HEMTs are suitable for a high-frequency gate driver from the logic level, and robustness of SiC MOSFET with high avalanche capability is suitable for a valve transistor in power converters. Our proposed gate driver consists of digital isolators, complementary Si MOSFETs, and GaN HEMTs. The GaN HEMT push-pull stage has a high driving capability owing to its superior switching characteristics, and complementary Si MOSFETs can enhance the control signal from the digital isolator. We investigated limiting factors of the switching frequency of the proposed gate driver by focusing on each circuit component and proposed an improved driving configuration for the gate driver. As a result, 20-MHz hard switching of a SiC MOSFET was achieved using the improved gate driver with GaN HEMTs.",

To evaluate its feasibility and limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive investigation into its accuracy, resolution, and stability towards yielding the structure information of SiC MOSFET using the source-drain voltage as the temperature sensitive electrical parameter. The whole characterization process involves two main procedures and associated key testing parameters, such as gate voltages, sensing and heating currents, etc. Their impacts on both the static and dynamic performances are also investigated with the aim of providing a guideline for conducting a reproducible thermal transient measurement for SiC MOSFETs.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-11-13T02:28:11",
        "content": "Compared with silicon (Si) power devices, Silicon carbide (SiC) devices have the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-resistance. However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs. All the parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the datasheet, which is practical in power electronics design.",

This study reports the occurrence and characterization of STEC from dairy cows and evaluates the inhibition of adherence by catlle anti-STEC antibodies to the HEp-2 cell. From 151 samples, 30% (n = 45) were positive for stx by PCR screening (25.21% of dairy cows and 46.8% of growing calves). From these positive samples, 17 STEC isolates were characterized. In dairy cows, 3 out of 17 samples carried stx2, 3 out of 17 possessed stx1, and 2 out of 17 carried stx1/stx2. In growing cows, 8 out of 17 samples carried stx1 and 1 out of 17 carried stx1/stx2. Other virulence factors such as ehxA, saa, iha, cah, and eae were detected. The strains were typed into 3 E. coli O groups (O26, O91, and O130). The analysis of the HEp-2 adherence assays indicated that all serum from both cattle categories presented high levels of inhibition of adherence. Considering the severity of the symptoms caused by STEC in humans, searching for factors influencing the colonization of STEC in cattle would help identify strategies to avoid transmission and STEC infection.",

        "content": "In this work, the origin of the low free electron mobility in SiC MOSFETs is investigated using the scattering theory of two-dimensional electron gases. We first establish that neither phonon scattering nor Coulomb scattering can be the cause of the low observed mobility in SiC MOSFETs; we establish this fact by comparing the theoretically calculated mobility considering these effects with experimental observations. By considering the threshold voltages and the effective field dependence of the mobility in SiC MOSFETs, it is concluded that the scattering centers of the dominant mechanism are electrically neutral and exhibit a short-range scattering potential. By considering charge distribution around a neutral defect at the interface, it is established that an electric dipole induced by the defect can act as a short-range scattering potential. We then calculate the mobility in SiC MOSFETs assuming that there exist a high density of dipoles at the interface. The calculated dipole-scattering-limited mobility shows a similar dependence on the effective field dependence to that observed in experimental results. Thus, we conclude that scattering induced by a high density of electric dipoles at the interface is dominant cause of the low mobility in SiC MOSFETs.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-01-15T22:21:05",
        "content": "The reliability of power semiconductor switches is important when considering their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea applications. Respect to technology advancements in material sciences, power MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si) based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs. Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET, CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a real application such as downhole motor drives.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-04-20T20:42:53",
        "content": "Fully-processed SiC power metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) emit light during switching of the gate terminal, while both drain and source terminals are grounded. The emitted photons are caused by defect-assisted recombination of electrons and holes at the 4H-SiC/SiO$_2$ interface and can be detected through the SiC substrate. Here, we present time-gated spectroscopic characterization of these interfacial point defects. Unlike in previous studies, the devices were opened in such a way that the drain-contact remained electrically active. A separate examination of the photons emitted at the rising and falling transitions of the gate-source voltage enabled the extraction of two different spectral components. One of these components consists of a single transition with phonon replicas of a local vibrational mode (LVM) with an astonishingly high energy of 220 meV $\\unicode{x2013}$ well above the highest phonon modes in 4H-SiC and SiO$_2$ of 120 meV and 137 meV, respectively. Based on a quantum mechanical model, we successfully fitted its emission spectrum and assigned it to donor-acceptor pair recombination involving a carbon cluster-like defect. Other transitions were assigned to EH$_{6/7}$-assisted, EK$_2$-D, and nitrogen-aluminum donor-acceptor pair recombination. Due to the relevance of these defects in the operation of SiC MOSFETs, these novel insights will contribute to improved reliability and performance of these devices.",

        "content": "Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a transboundary, viral disease of cattle with a significant economic impact on the livestock industry. This study describes the epidemiological investigations of outbreaks of LSD that occurred in 2022 in three Indian states viz., Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan and the genetic characterization of Lumpy skin disease viruses (LSDVs). Also, the population structure analysis of LSDVs was carried out. Out of 138 scab samples tested from suspected cattle for LSDV, 106 were found positive. Of these, nine representative scab samples were further genetically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis based on the P32 and EEV gene sequences depicted that the LSDV strains of the present study had nucleotide identity of 100% and 99.10-99.45%, respectively with the LSDV/2019 field strains of India. Multiple sequence alignment of the EEV glycoprotein gene sequences revealed nucleotide polymorphisms at three positions viz., G178A, G253A and A459G in circulating LSDV/2022 field strains. Based on the median joining network analysis of the EEV gene, 12 haplotypes were identified among the LSDV populations. Population structure analysis corresponding to the EEV gene revealed high haplotype (0.8486 ± 0.026) and low nucleotide diversities (0.00636 ± 0.0006) and negative values for neutrality indices, indicating a high number of closely related haplotypes and the studied population may have undergone a recent expansion. The findings will help in understanding the distribution and dynamics of LSDV populations, which will prove pivotal in designing and implementing effective management and control strategies.",

        "content": "Inter-terminal capacitances (ITCs) have major influence on the dynamic performance of power SiC MOSFETs. Knowledge of the exact values for the ITCs is required in order to perform accurate and predictive compact model simulations of their dynamic performance. Since commercial SiC MOSFETs are capable of operating in a wide range of temperatures, it is important to know the values of ITCs in the whole temperature range of operation. Direct measurements of the ITCs with standard equipment is possible only at low current levels (i.e. in the off-state (Vgs < Vth) for Vds > 0 V), however their values in the on-state (Vgs>Vth) also influence the MOSFETs switching performance. In this work, ITCs of a planar SiC MOSFET in the on-state are studied by the means of a calibrated TCAD model, revealing substantial temperature dependence in the range of 300-450 K. In the first approximation, this temperature dependence of the ITCs can be explained by a weaker temperature dependence of the MOSFET channel resistance in comparison to its JFET and epitaxial layer resistances. In addition, it is shown that at high frequencies stray inductances of the TO-247-3 package result in a change of the extracted values of the on-state ITCs. This effect is already notable at 1 MHz.",

Low on-resistance and low input capacitance of GaN HEMTs are suitable for a high-frequency gate driver from the logic level, and robustness of SiC MOSFET with high avalanche capability is suitable for a valve transistor in power converters. Our proposed gate driver consists of digital isolators, complementary Si MOSFETs, and GaN HEMTs. The GaN HEMT push-pull stage has a high driving capability owing to its superior switching characteristics, and complementary Si MOSFETs can enhance the control signal from the digital isolator. We investigated limiting factors of the switching frequency of the proposed gate driver by focusing on each circuit component and proposed an improved driving configuration for the gate driver. As a result, 20-MHz hard switching of a SiC MOSFET was achieved using the improved gate driver with GaN HEMTs.",

        "content": "The formacion of numerous unpredictable DNA Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) on chromosomes iniciates meiotic recombination. In this perspective, we propose a 'multi-key lock' model to secure the risky but necesary breaks as well as a 'one per pair of cromatids' model for the topoisomerase-like early recombinosome. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes recombine at few sites of crossing-overs (COs) to ensure correct segregation. The initiation of meiotic recombination involves the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) during prophase I. Too many DSBs are dangerous for genome integrity: if these DSBs are not properly repaired, it could potentially lead to chromosomal fragmentation. Too few DSBs are also problematic: if the obligate CO cannot form between bivalents, catastrophic unequal segregation of univalents lead to the formation of sterile aneuploid spores. Research on the regulation of the formation of these necessary but risky DSBs has recently advanced in yeast, mammals and plants. DNA DSBs are created by the enzymatic activity of the early recombinosome, a topoisomerase-like complex containing SPO11. This opinion paper reviews recent insights on the regulation of the SPO11 cofactors necessary for the introduction of temporally and spatially controlled DSBs. We propose that a 'multi-key-lock' model for each subunit of the early recombinosome complex is required to secure the formation of DSBs. We also discuss the hypothetical implications that the established topoisomerase-like nature of the SPO11 core-complex can have in creating DSB in only one of the two replicated chromatids of early prophase I meiotic chromosomes. This hypothetical 'one per pair of chromatids' DSB formation model could optimize the faithful repair of the self-inflicted DSBs. Each DSB could use three potential intact homologous DNA sequences as repair template: one from the sister chromatid and the two others from the homologous chromosomes.",

        "content": "The origin of dielectric breakdown was studied on 4H-SiC MOSFETs that failed after three months of high temperature reverse bias (HTRB) stress. A local inspection of the failed devices demonstrated the presence of a threading dislocation (TD) at the breakdown location. The nanoscale origin of the dielectric breakdown was highlighted with advanced high-spatial-resolution scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques. In particular, SPM revealed the conductive nature of the TD and a local increase of the minority carrier concentration close to the defect. Numerical simulations estimated a hole concentration 13 orders of magnitude larger than in the ideal 4H-SiC crystal. The hole injection in specific regions of the device explained the failure of the gate oxide under stress. In this way, the key role of the TD in the dielectric breakdown of 4H-SiC MOSFET was unambiguously demonstrated.",

        "publishedDate": "2022-10-13T23:45:37",
        "content": "Ulta-wide bandgap semiconductors based on $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ offer the potential to achieve higher power switching performance, efficiency, and lower manufacturing cost than today's wide bandgap power semiconductors. However, the most critical challenge to the commercialization of Ga$_2$O$_3$ electronics is overheating, which impacts the device's performance and reliability. We fabricated a Ga$_2$O$_3$/4H-SiC composite wafer using a fusion-bonding method. A low temperature ($\\le$ 600 $^{\\circ}$C) epitaxy and device processing approach based on low-temperature (LT) metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy is developed to grow a Ga$_2$O$_3$ epitaxial channel layer on the composite wafer and subsequently fabricate into Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs. This LT approach is essential to preserve the structural integrity of the composite wafer. These LT-grown epitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSFETs deliver high thermal performance (56% reduction in channel temperature), high voltage blocking capabilities up to 2.45 kV, and power figures of merit of $\\sim$ 300 MW/cm$^2$, which is a record high for any heterogeneously integrated Ga$_2$O$_3$ devices reported to date. This work is the first realization of multi-kilovolt homoepitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs fabricated on a composite substrate with high heat transfer performance which delivers state-of-the-art power density values while running much cooler than those on native substrates. Thermal characterization and modeling results reveal that a Ga$_2$O$_3$/diamond composite wafer with a reduced Ga$_2$O$_3$ thickness ($\\sim$ 1 $\\mu$m) and thinner bonding interlayer ($<$ 10 nm) can reduce the device thermal impedance to a level lower than today's GaN-on-SiC power switches.",

To evaluate its feasibility and limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive investigation into its accuracy, resolution, and stability towards yielding the structure information of SiC MOSFET using the source-drain voltage as the temperature sensitive electrical parameter. The whole characterization process involves two main procedures and associated key testing parameters, such as gate voltages, sensing and heating currents, etc. Their impacts on both the static and dynamic performances are also investigated with the aim of providing a guideline for conducting a reproducible thermal transient measurement for SiC MOSFETs.",

A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.",

        "content": "Renewable energy source such as photovoltaic (PV) cell generates power from the sun light by converting solar power to electrical power with no moving parts and less maintenance. A single photovoltaic cell produces voltage of low level. In order to boost up the voltage, a DC-DC boost converter is used. In order to use this DC-DC converter for high voltage and high frequency applications, Silicon Carbide (SiC) device is most preferred because of larger current carrying capability, higher voltage blocking capability, high operating temperature and less static and dynamic losses than the traditional silicon (Si) power switches. In the proposed work, the static and dynamic characteristics of SiC MOSFET for different temperatures are observed. A SiC MOSFET based boost converter is investigated which is powered by PV source. This DC - DC converter is controlled using a Pulse-Width Method (PWM) and the duty cycle d is calculated for tracking the maximum power point using incremental conductance algorithm of the PV systems implemented in FPGA. Simulation studies are carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK.A prototype of the SiC converter is built and the results are verified experimentally. The performance parameters of the proposed converter such as output voltage ripple input current ripple and losses are computed and it is compared with the classical silicon (Si) MOSFET converter.",

        "publishedDate": "2022-10-13T23:45:37",
        "content": "Ulta-wide bandgap semiconductors based on $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ offer the potential to achieve higher power switching performance, efficiency, and lower manufacturing cost than today's wide bandgap power semiconductors. However, the most critical challenge to the commercialization of Ga$_2$O$_3$ electronics is overheating, which impacts the device's performance and reliability. We fabricated a Ga$_2$O$_3$/4H-SiC composite wafer using a fusion-bonding method. A low temperature ($\\le$ 600 $^{\\circ}$C) epitaxy and device processing approach based on low-temperature (LT) metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy is developed to grow a Ga$_2$O$_3$ epitaxial channel layer on the composite wafer and subsequently fabricate into Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs. This LT approach is essential to preserve the structural integrity of the composite wafer. These LT-grown epitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSFETs deliver high thermal performance (56% reduction in channel temperature), high voltage blocking capabilities up to 2.45 kV, and power figures of merit of $\\sim$ 300 MW/cm$^2$, which is a record high for any heterogeneously integrated Ga$_2$O$_3$ devices reported to date. This work is the first realization of multi-kilovolt homoepitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs fabricated on a composite substrate with high heat transfer performance which delivers state-of-the-art power density values while running much cooler than those on native substrates. Thermal characterization and modeling results reveal that a Ga$_2$O$_3$/diamond composite wafer with a reduced Ga$_2$O$_3$ thickness ($\\sim$ 1 $\\mu$m) and thinner bonding interlayer ($<$ 10 nm) can reduce the device thermal impedance to a level lower than today's GaN-on-SiC power switches.",

        "content": "Compared with silicon (Si) power devices, Silicon carbide (SiC) devices have the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-resistance. However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs. All the parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the datasheet, which is practical in power electronics design.",

        "content": "In this work, the origin of the low free electron mobility in SiC MOSFETs is investigated using the scattering theory of two-dimensional electron gases. We first establish that neither phonon scattering nor Coulomb scattering can be the cause of the low observed mobility in SiC MOSFETs; we establish this fact by comparing the theoretically calculated mobility considering these effects with experimental observations. By considering the threshold voltages and the effective field dependence of the mobility in SiC MOSFETs, it is concluded that the scattering centers of the dominant mechanism are electrically neutral and exhibit a short-range scattering potential. By considering charge distribution around a neutral defect at the interface, it is established that an electric dipole induced by the defect can act as a short-range scattering potential. We then calculate the mobility in SiC MOSFETs assuming that there exist a high density of dipoles at the interface. The calculated dipole-scattering-limited mobility shows a similar dependence on the effective field dependence to that observed in experimental results. Thus, we conclude that scattering induced by a high density of electric dipoles at the interface is dominant cause of the low mobility in SiC MOSFETs.",

        "content": "This article studies the possibility of controlling the surge impedance of the electric motor in motor drives. The existing solution to suppress (or eliminate) the reflected wave impact on the motor insulation run by a Si-IGBT or SiC-MOSFET-based drive is to use either a sinewave filter or dv/dt filter. The alternative solution suggested in this article is to implement a high-bandwidth electronic circuit at the end of the cable or at the motor terminals to match the surge impedance of the cable and motor. The high-frequency voltage ringing due to the reflected waves in motor drives is around 1 MHz, depending on the cable parameters and the length of the cable. In the proposed method, the electronic circuit can quickly detect the dv/dt rise and fall edges and adjust the electronic circuit equivalent impedance when pulses arrive the motor terminals. Thus, the cable and motor surge impedances can be matched over a short time to prevent reflected waves. As a result, the leakage currents passing through the ball bearing and overvoltage stress on the motor insulation can be suppressed significantly.",

A wide range of α-substituted vinyl azides were tolerated under mild conditions. Notably, the resulting cycloadducts could be transformed into structurally attractive 3-azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptenes through microwave-promoted rearrangement. The utilities were highlighted by copper(I)-catalyzed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of tertiary alkyl azide and further transformation of the azide and ketone groups.",

It is shown that electrospray ionization (ESI)-like mass spectra of a range of peptides and proteins can be acquired by LAP-MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) as previously demonstrated on a homemade LAP-MALDI-Q-TOF setup but without the need of any modification to the commercially available MS equipment used. Multiply charged peptide ions were recorded with a resolution of around 100,000 and a mass accuracy of less than 5 ppm.

        "publishedDate": "2020-01-15T22:21:05",
        "content": "The reliability of power semiconductor switches is important when considering their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea applications. Respect to technology advancements in material sciences, power MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si) based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs. Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET, CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a real application such as downhole motor drives.",

        "content": "Relative binding free energy (RBFE) simulation is a rigorous approach to the calculation of quantitatively accurate binding free energy values for protein-ligand binding in which a reference binder is gradually converted to a target binder through alchemical transformation during the simulation. The success of such simulations relies on being able to accurately sample the correct conformational phase space for each alchemical state; however, this becomes a challenge when a significant conformation change occurs between the reference and target binder-receptor complexes. Increasing the simulation time and using enhanced sampling methods can be helpful, but effects can be limited, especially when the free energy barrier between conformations is high or when the correct target complex conformation is difficult to find and maintain. Current RBFE protocols seed the reference complex structure into every alchemical window of the simulation. In our study, we describe an improved protocol in which the reference structure is seeded into the first half of the alchemical windows, and the target structure is seeded into the second half of the alchemical windows. By applying information about the relevant correct end point conformations to different simulation windows from the beginning, the need for large barrier crossings or simulation prediction of the correct structures during an alchemical simulation is in many cases obviated. In the diverse cases we examine below, the simulations yielded free energy predictions that are satisfactory as compared to experiment and superior to running the simulations utilizing the conventional protocol. The method is straightforward to implement for publicly available FEP workflows.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-04-20T20:42:53",
        "content": "Fully-processed SiC power metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) emit light during switching of the gate terminal, while both drain and source terminals are grounded. The emitted photons are caused by defect-assisted recombination of electrons and holes at the 4H-SiC/SiO$_2$ interface and can be detected through the SiC substrate. Here, we present time-gated spectroscopic characterization of these interfacial point defects. Unlike in previous studies, the devices were opened in such a way that the drain-contact remained electrically active. A separate examination of the photons emitted at the rising and falling transitions of the gate-source voltage enabled the extraction of two different spectral components. One of these components consists of a single transition with phonon replicas of a local vibrational mode (LVM) with an astonishingly high energy of 220 meV $\\unicode{x2013}$ well above the highest phonon modes in 4H-SiC and SiO$_2$ of 120 meV and 137 meV, respectively. Based on a quantum mechanical model, we successfully fitted its emission spectrum and assigned it to donor-acceptor pair recombination involving a carbon cluster-like defect. Other transitions were assigned to EH$_{6/7}$-assisted, EK$_2$-D, and nitrogen-aluminum donor-acceptor pair recombination. Due to the relevance of these defects in the operation of SiC MOSFETs, these novel insights will contribute to improved reliability and performance of these devices.",

        "content": "This was a prospective, interventional, comparative study conducted on patients with congenital simple severe ptosis. A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.",

        "content": "Renewable energy source such as photovoltaic (PV) cell generates power from the sun light by converting solar power to electrical power with no moving parts and less maintenance. A single photovoltaic cell produces voltage of low level. In order to boost up the voltage, a DC-DC boost converter is used. In order to use this DC-DC converter for high voltage and high frequency applications, Silicon Carbide (SiC) device is most preferred because of larger current carrying capability, higher voltage blocking capability, high operating temperature and less static and dynamic losses than the traditional silicon (Si) power switches. In the proposed work, the static and dynamic characteristics of SiC MOSFET for different temperatures are observed. A SiC MOSFET based boost converter is investigated which is powered by PV source. This DC - DC converter is controlled using a Pulse-Width Method (PWM) and the duty cycle d is calculated for tracking the maximum power point using incremental conductance algorithm of the PV systems implemented in FPGA. Simulation studies are carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK.A prototype of the SiC converter is built and the results are verified experimentally. The performance parameters of the proposed converter such as output voltage ripple input current ripple and losses are computed and it is compared with the classical silicon (Si) MOSFET converter.",

        "publishedDate": "2022-10-13T23:45:37",
        "content": "Ulta-wide bandgap semiconductors based on $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ offer the potential to achieve higher power switching performance, efficiency, and lower manufacturing cost than today's wide bandgap power semiconductors. However, the most critical challenge to the commercialization of Ga$_2$O$_3$ electronics is overheating, which impacts the device's performance and reliability. We fabricated a Ga$_2$O$_3$/4H-SiC composite wafer using a fusion-bonding method. A low temperature ($\\le$ 600 $^{\\circ}$C) epitaxy and device processing approach based on low-temperature (LT) metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy is developed to grow a Ga$_2$O$_3$ epitaxial channel layer on the composite wafer and subsequently fabricate into Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs. This LT approach is essential to preserve the structural integrity of the composite wafer. These LT-grown epitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSFETs deliver high thermal performance (56% reduction in channel temperature), high voltage blocking capabilities up to 2.45 kV, and power figures of merit of $\\sim$ 300 MW/cm$^2$, which is a record high for any heterogeneously integrated Ga$_2$O$_3$ devices reported to date. This work is the first realization of multi-kilovolt homoepitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs fabricated on a composite substrate with high heat transfer performance which delivers state-of-the-art power density values while running much cooler than those on native substrates. Thermal characterization and modeling results reveal that a Ga$_2$O$_3$/diamond composite wafer with a reduced Ga$_2$O$_3$ thickness ($\\sim$ 1 $\\mu$m) and thinner bonding interlayer ($<$ 10 nm) can reduce the device thermal impedance to a level lower than today's GaN-on-SiC power switches.",

        "content": "Compared with silicon (Si) power devices, Silicon carbide (SiC) devices have the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-resistance. However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs. All the parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the datasheet, which is practical in power electronics design.",

        "content": "In this work, the origin of the low free electron mobility in SiC MOSFETs is investigated using the scattering theory of two-dimensional electron gases. We first establish that neither phonon scattering nor Coulomb scattering can be the cause of the low observed mobility in SiC MOSFETs; we establish this fact by comparing the theoretically calculated mobility considering these effects with experimental observations. By considering the threshold voltages and the effective field dependence of the mobility in SiC MOSFETs, it is concluded that the scattering centers of the dominant mechanism are electrically neutral and exhibit a short-range scattering potential. By considering charge distribution around a neutral defect at the interface, it is established that an electric dipole induced by the defect can act as a short-range scattering potential. We then calculate the mobility in SiC MOSFETs assuming that there exist a high density of dipoles at the interface. The calculated dipole-scattering-limited mobility shows a similar dependence on the effective field dependence to that observed in experimental results. Thus, we conclude that scattering induced by a high density of electric dipoles at the interface is dominant cause of the low mobility in SiC MOSFETs.",

        "content": "This article studies the possibility of controlling the surge impedance of the electric motor in motor drives. The existing solution to suppress (or eliminate) the reflected wave impact on the motor insulation run by a Si-IGBT or SiC-MOSFET-based drive is to use either a sinewave filter or dv/dt filter. The alternative solution suggested in this article is to implement a high-bandwidth electronic circuit at the end of the cable or at the motor terminals to match the surge impedance of the cable and motor. The high-frequency voltage ringing due to the reflected waves in motor drives is around 1 MHz, depending on the cable parameters and the length of the cable. In the proposed method, the electronic circuit can quickly detect the dv/dt rise and fall edges and adjust the electronic circuit equivalent impedance when pulses arrive the motor terminals. Thus, the cable and motor surge impedances can be matched over a short time to prevent reflected waves. As a result, the leakage currents passing through the ball bearing and overvoltage stress on the motor insulation can be suppressed significantly.",

Multiply charged peptide ions were recorded with a resolution of around 100,000 and a mass accuracy of less than 5 ppm.

        "publishedDate": "2020-01-15T22:21:05",
        "content": "The reliability of power semiconductor switches is important when considering their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea applications. Respect to technology advancements in material sciences, power MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si) based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs. Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET, CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a real application such as downhole motor drives.",

        "content": "Relative binding free energy (RBFE) simulation is a rigorous approach to the calculation of quantitatively accurate binding free energy values for protein-ligand binding in which a reference binder is gradually converted to a target binder through alchemical transformation during the simulation. The success of such simulations relies on being able to accurately sample the correct conformational phase space for each alchemical state; however, this becomes a challenge when a significant conformation change occurs between the reference and target binder-receptor complexes. Increasing the simulation time and using enhanced sampling methods can be helpful, but effects can be limited, especially when the free energy barrier between conformations is high or when the correct target complex conformation is difficult to find and maintain. Current RBFE protocols seed the reference complex structure into every alchemical window of the simulation. In our study, we describe an improved protocol in which the reference structure is seeded into the first half of the alchemical windows, and the target structure is seeded into the second half of the alchemical windows. By applying information about the relevant correct end point conformations to different simulation windows from the beginning, the need for large barrier crossings or simulation prediction of the correct structures during an alchemical simulation is in many cases obviated. In the diverse cases we examine below, the simulations yielded free energy predictions that are satisfactory as compared to experiment and superior to running the simulations utilizing the conventional protocol. The method is straightforward to implement for publicly available FEP workflows.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-04-20T20:42:53",
        "content": "Fully-processed SiC power metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) emit light during switching of the gate terminal, while both drain and source terminals are grounded. The emitted photons are caused by defect-assisted recombination of electrons and holes at the 4H-SiC/SiO$_2$ interface and can be detected through the SiC substrate. Here, we present time-gated spectroscopic characterization of these interfacial point defects. Unlike in previous studies, the devices were opened in such a way that the drain-contact remained electrically active. A separate examination of the photons emitted at the rising and falling transitions of the gate-source voltage enabled the extraction of two different spectral components. One of these components consists of a single transition with phonon replicas of a local vibrational mode (LVM) with an astonishingly high energy of 220 meV $\\unicode{x2013}$ well above the highest phonon modes in 4H-SiC and SiO$_2$ of 120 meV and 137 meV, respectively. Based on a quantum mechanical model, we successfully fitted its emission spectrum and assigned it to donor-acceptor pair recombination involving a carbon cluster-like defect. Other transitions were assigned to EH$_{6/7}$-assisted, EK$_2$-D, and nitrogen-aluminum donor-acceptor pair recombination. Due to the relevance of these defects in the operation of SiC MOSFETs, these novel insights will contribute to improved reliability and performance of these devices.",

We identify the connection between the difficulty level and the number and variety of symmetries in PR problems. We focus on the most difficult far-field PR (FFPR), and propose a novel method using double deep image priors. In realistic evaluation, our method outperforms all competing methods by large margins. As a single-instance method, our method requires no training data and minimal hyperparameter tuning, and hence enjoys good practicality.",

        "content": "This was a prospective, interventional, comparative study conducted on patients with congenital simple severe ptosis. A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.",

        "content": "Compact neutron imagers using double-scatter kinematic reconstruction are being designed for localization and characterization of special nuclear material. These neutron imaging systems rely on scintillators with a rapid prompt temporal response as the detection medium. As n-p elastic scattering is the primary mechanism for light generation by fast neutron interactions in organic scintillators, proton light yield data are needed for accurate assessment of scintillator performance. The proton light yield of a series of commercial fast plastic organic scintillators---EJ-200, EJ-204, and EJ-208---was measured via a double time-of-flight technique at the 88-Inch Cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Using a tunable deuteron breakup neutron source, target scintillators housed in a dual photomultiplier tube configuration, and an array of pulse-shape-discriminating observation scintillators, the fast plastic scintillator light yield was measured over a broad and continuous energy range down to proton recoil energies of approximately 50 keV. This work provides key input to event reconstruction algorithms required for utilization of these materials in emerging neutron imaging modalities.",

        "content": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have great potential for the adsorption of minor molecular alcohols in the vapor phase. However, the drawbacks of powdered MOFs, including low recyclability and problematic separation, limit their application in fermented wine. Chitosan (CS) is a low-cost, eco-friendly, moldable matrix used in the food industry. In this study, a novel CS@ZIF-8 adsorbent with excellent microporous surface area was successfully synthesized by incorporating hydrophobic ZIF-8 into CS. The results showed that CS@ZIF-8 beads had a high adsorption affinity for methanol at a Zn",

        "publishedDate": "2019-10-03T13:40:46",
        "content": "Many real world tasks require multiple agents to work together. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been proposed in recent years to solve these tasks, but current methods often fail to efficiently learn policies. We thus investigate the presence of a common weakness in single-agent RL, namely value function overestimation bias, in the multi-agent setting. Based on our findings, we propose an approach that reduces this bias by using double centralized critics. We evaluate it on six mixed cooperative-competitive tasks, showing a significant advantage over current methods. Finally, we investigate the application of multi-agent methods to high-dimensional robotic tasks and show that our approach can be used to learn decentralized policies in this domain.",

Multiply charged peptide ions were recorded with a resolution of around 100,000 and a mass accuracy of less than 5 ppm.

The method's resolution makes multidimensional coherent spectroscopy relevant for atomic systems that have narrow resonances.

We observe tilted lineshapes in the double-quantum 2D spectra, which has never been reported for Doppler-broadened systems.

        "title": "A Method for Treating Significant Conformational Changes in Alchemical Free Energy Simulations of Protein-Ligand Binding.",
        "content": "Relative binding free energy (RBFE) simulation is a rigorous approach to the calculation of quantitatively accurate binding free energy values for protein-ligand binding in which a reference binder is gradually converted to a target binder through alchemical transformation during the simulation. The success of such simulations relies on being able to accurately sample the correct conformational phase space for each alchemical state; however, this becomes a challenge when a significant conformation change occurs between the reference and target binder-receptor complexes. Increasing the simulation time and using enhanced sampling methods can be helpful, but effects can be limited, especially when the free energy barrier between conformations is high or when the correct target complex conformation is difficult to find and maintain. Current RBFE protocols seed the reference complex structure into every alchemical window of the simulation. In our study, we describe an improved protocol in which the reference structure is seeded into the first half of the alchemical windows, and the target structure is seeded into the second half of the alchemical windows. By applying information about the relevant correct end point conformations to different simulation windows from the beginning, the need for large barrier crossings or simulation prediction of the correct structures during an alchemical simulation is in many cases obviated. In the diverse cases we examine below, the simulations yielded free energy predictions that are satisfactory as compared to experiment and superior to running the simulations utilizing the conventional protocol. The method is straightforward to implement for publicly available FEP workflows.",

        "content": "This was a prospective, interventional, comparative study conducted on patients with congenital simple severe ptosis. A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.",

It is shown that electrospray ionization (ESI)-like mass spectra of a range of peptides and proteins can be acquired by LAP-MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) as previously demonstrated on a homemade LAP-MALDI-Q-TOF setup but without the need of any modification to the commercially available MS equipment used. Multiply charged peptide ions were recorded with a resolution of around 100,000 and a mass accuracy of less than 5 ppm. The higher resolution and mass accuracy of the orbitrap analyzer compared with previously employed Q-TOF instrumentation provided high confidence in bacterial proteoform and species identification by top-down protein analysis.",

        "title": "A Method for Treating Significant Conformational Changes in Alchemical Free Energy Simulations of Protein-Ligand Binding.",
        "content": "Relative binding free energy (RBFE) simulation is a rigorous approach to the calculation of quantitatively accurate binding free energy values for protein-ligand binding in which a reference binder is gradually converted to a target binder through alchemical transformation during the simulation. The success of such simulations relies on being able to accurately sample the correct conformational phase space for each alchemical state; however, this becomes a challenge when a significant conformation change occurs between the reference and target binder-receptor complexes. Increasing the simulation time and using enhanced sampling methods can be helpful, but effects can be limited, especially when the free energy barrier between conformations is high or when the correct target complex conformation is difficult to find and maintain. Current RBFE protocols seed the reference complex structure into every alchemical window of the simulation. In our study, we describe an improved protocol in which the reference structure is seeded into the first half of the alchemical windows, and the target structure is seeded into the second half of the alchemical windows. By applying information about the relevant correct end point conformations to different simulation windows from the beginning, the need for large barrier crossings or simulation prediction of the correct structures during an alchemical simulation is in many cases obviated. In the diverse cases we examine below, the simulations yielded free energy predictions that are satisfactory as compared to experiment and superior to running the simulations utilizing the conventional protocol. The method is straightforward to implement for publicly available FEP workflows.",
