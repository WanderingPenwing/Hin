        "content": "International audience; The research work presented in this paper aims to optimize the dynamic response of a carbon-epoxy plate by including into the laminate one frequency-dependent interleaved viscoelastic layer. To keep an acceptable bending stiffness, some holes are created in the viscoelastic layer, thus facilitating the resin through layer penetration during the co-curing manufacturing process. Plates including (or not) one perforated (or non-perforated) viscoelastic layer are manufactured and investigated experimentally and numerically. First, static and dynamic tests are performed on sandwich coupons to characterize the stiffness and damping properties of the plates in a given frequency range. Resulting mechanical properties are then used to set-up a finite element model and simulate the plate dynamic response. In parallel, frequency response measurements are carried out on the manufactured plates, then successfully confronted to the numerical results. Finally, a design of experiments is built based on a limited number on numerical simulations to find the configuration of bridges that maximizes the damping while keeping a stiffness higher than half the stiffness of the equivalent undamped plate.",

        "publishedDate": "2021-05-19T16:45:42",
        "content": "We investigate freely expanding viscoelastic sheets. The sheets are produced by the impact of drops on a quartz plate covered with a thin layer of liquid nitrogen that suppresses shear viscous dissipation as a result of the cold Leidenfrost effect. The time evolution of the sheet is simultaneously recorded from top and side views using high-speed cameras. The investigated viscoelastic fluids are Maxwell fluids, which are characterized by low elastic moduli, and relaxation times that vary over almost two orders of magnitude, thus giving access to a large spectrum of viscoelastic and elastocapillary effects. For the purposes of comparison, Newtonian fluids, with viscosity varying over three orders of magnitude, are also investigated. In this study, $d_{\\mathrm{max}}$, the maximal expansion of the sheets, and $t_{\\mathrm{max}}$ the time to reach this maximal expansion from the time at impact, are measured as a function of the impact velocity. By using a generalized damped harmonic oscillator model, we rationalize the role of capillarity, bulk elasticity and viscous dissipation in the expansion dynamics of all investigated samples. In the model, the spring constant is a combination of the surface tension and the bulk dynamic elastic modulus. The time-varying damping coefficient is associated to biaxial extensional viscous dissipation and is proportional to the dynamic loss modulus. For all samples, we find that the model reproduces accurately the experimental data for $d_{\\mathrm{max}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{max}}$.",

        "content": "It is well known that a boundary layer develops along an infinite plate under oscillatory motion in a Newtonian fluid. In this work, this oscillatory boundary layer theory is generalized to the case of linear viscoelastic(LVE) flow. We demonstrate that the dynamics in LVE are generically different than those for flow of similar settings in Newtonian fluids, in several aspects. These new discoveries are expected to have consequences on related engineering applications. Mimicking the theory for Stokes oscillatory layers along an infinite plate in Newtonian flow, we derive a similar oscillatory boundary layer formula for the case of LVE. In fact, the new theory includes the Stokes layer theory as a special case. For the disturbance flow caused by particles undergoing oscillatory motion in linear viscoelasticity(LVE), a numerical investigation is necessary. A boundary integral method is developed for this purpose. We verify our numerical method by comparing its results to an existing analytic solution, in the simple case of a spherical particle. Then the numerical method is applied in case studies of more general geometries. Two geometries are considered because of their prevalence in applications: spheroids; dumbbells and biconcave disks.",

        "content": "The extended plane wave expansion (EPWE) formulation is derived to obtain the complex band structure of flexural waves in viscoelastic thin phononic crystal plates considering the Kirchhoff-Love plate theory. The presented formulation yields the evanescent behavior of flexural waves in periodic thin plates considering viscoelastic effects. The viscosity is modeled by the standard linear solid model (SLSM), typically used to closely model the behavior of polymers. It is observed that the viscoelasticity influences significantly both the propagating and evanescent Bloch modes. The highest wave attenuation of the viscoelastic phononic thin plate is found around a unit cell filling fraction of 0.37 for higher frequencies considering the least attenuated wave mode. This EPWE formulation broadens the suitable methods to handle evanescent flexural waves in 2-D thin periodic plate systems considering the effects of viscoelasticity on wave attenuation.",

Energy damping rates are measured for oblate and prolate bodies with different spin rates, spin states, viscoelastic relaxation timescales, axis ratios, and strengths. Analytical models using a quality factor by Breiter et al.

Simulations of nearly spherical but wobbling bodies with hard and soft cores show that the energy dissipation rate is more sensitive to the material properties in the core than near the surface. The sensitivity to viscoelastic model implies that inferred statistics of tumbling lifetimes in asteroids might be interpreted in terms of differences in their material properties.",

        "content": "The Oldroyd-B model has been used extensively to predict a host of instabilities in shearing flows of viscoelastic fluids, often realized experimentally using polymer solutions. The present review, written on the occasion of the birth centenary of James Oldroyd, provides an overview of instabilities found across major classes of shearing flows. These comprise (i) the canonical rectilinear shearing flows including plane Couette, plane and pipe Poiseuille flows; (ii) viscometric shearing flows with curved streamlines such as those in the Taylor-Couette, cone-and-plate and parallel-plate geometries; (iii) non-viscometric shearing flows with an underlying extensional flow topology such as the flow in a cross-slot device; and (iv) multilayer shearing flows. While the underlying focus in all these cases is on results obtained using the Oldroyd-B model, we also discuss their relation to the actual instability, and as to how the shortcomings of the Oldroyd-B model may be overcome by the use of more realistic constitutive models. All the three commonly used tools of stability analysis, viz., modal linear stability, nonmodal stability, and weakly nonlinear stability analyses are discussed, with supporting evidence from experiments and numerical simulations as appropriate. Despite only accounting for a shear-rate-independent viscosity and first normal stress coefficient, the Oldroyd-B model is able to qualitatively predict the majority of instabilities in the aforementioned shearing flows. The review also highlights, where appropriate, open questions in the area of viscoelastic stability.",

        "content": "This paper reports the real time monitoring of siderite deposition, on both Au- and Fe-coated surfaces, using the changes in frequency and dissipation of quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCMD). In an iron chloride solution saturated with carbon dioxide, buffered with sodium bicarbonate to pH 6.8, roughly spherical particles of siderite formed within 15 min, which subsequently deposited on the QCMD crystal surface. Imaging of the surface showed a layer formed from particles ca. < 0.5 μm in diameter. Larger particles are clearly deposited on top of the lower layer; these larger particles are >1 μm in diameter. Monitoring of the frequency clearly differentiates the formation of the lower layer from the larger crystals deposited on top at later times. The elastic moduli calculated from QCMD data showed a progressive dissipation increase; the modeling of the solid-liquid interface using a flat approximation resulted in a poor estimation of elastic and storage moduli. Rather, the impedance modeled as a viscoelastic layer in contact with a semi-infinite liquid, where a random bumpy surface with a Gaussian correlator is used, is much more accurate in determining the elastic and storage moduli as losses from the uneven interface are considered. A further step considers that the film is in fact a composite consisting of hard spherical particles of siderite with water in the vacant spaces. This is treated by considering the individual contributions of the phases to the losses measured, thereby further improving the accuracy of the description of the film and the QCMD data. Collectively, this work presents a new framework for the use of QCMD, paired with traditional approaches, to enhance the understanding of crystal deposition and film formation as well as quantify the often evolving mechanical properties.",

        "content": "We consider a cylinder immersed in viscous fluid moving near a flat substrate covered by an incompressible viscoelastic fluid layer, and study the effect of the fluid viscoelasticity on the lift force exerted on the cylinder. The lift force is zero when the viscoelastic layer is not deformed, but becomes non-zero when it is deformed. We calculate the lift force by considering both the tangential stress and the normal stress applied at the surface of the viscoelastic layer. Our analysis indicates that as the layer changes from the elastic limit to the viscous limit, the lift force decreases with the decrease of the Deborah number (De). For small De, the effect of the layer elasticity is taken over by the surface tension and the lift force can become negative. We also show that the tangential stress and the interface slip velocity (the surface velocity relative to the substrate), which have been ignored in the previous analysis, give important contributions to the lift force. Especially for thin elastic layers, they give dominant contributions to the lift force.",

        "content": "An enhanced lightness and thinness is the inevitable trend of modern industrial production, which will also lead to prominent low-frequency vibration problems in the associated structure. To solve the vibration problem of thin plate structures in various engineering fields, the active constrained layer damping (ACLD) thin plate structure is taken as the research object to study vibration control. Based on the FEM method, energy method, and Hamilton principle, the dynamic model of an ACLD thin plate structure is derived, in which the Golla-Hughes-McTavish (GHM) model is used to characterize the damping characteristics of the viscoelastic layer, and the equivalent Rayleigh damping is used to characterize the damping characteristics of the base layer. The order of the model is reduced based on the high-precision physical condensation method and balance reduction method, and the model has good controllability and observability. An LQR controller is designed to actively control the ACLD sheet, and the controller parameters and piezoelectric sheet parameters are optimized. The results show that the finite element model established in this paper is accurate under different boundary conditions, and the model can still accurately and reliably describe the dynamic characteristics of the original system in the time and frequency domain after using the joint reduction method. Under different excitation and boundary conditions, LQR control can effectively suppress structural vibration. Considering the performance and cost balance, the most suitable control parameter for the system is: Q-matrix coefficient is between 1 × 10",

        "content": "A finite element dynamic model of the sandwich composite plate was developed based on classical laminate theory and Hamilton's principle. A 4-node, 7-degree-of-freedom three-layer plate cell is constructed to simulate the interaction between the substrate, the viscoelastic damping layer, and the piezoelectric material layer. Among them, the viscoelastic layer is referred to as the complex constant shear modulus model, and the equivalent Rayleigh damping is introduced to represent the damping of the substrate. The established dynamics model has too many degrees of freedom, and the obtained dynamics model has good controllability and observability after adopting the joint reduced-order method of dynamic condensation in physical space and equilibrium in state space. The optimal quadratic (LQR) controller is designed for the active control of the sandwich panel, and the parameters of the controller parameters, the thickness of the viscoelastic layer, and the optimal covering position of the sandwich panel are optimized through simulation analysis. The results show that the finite element model established in this paper is still valid under different boundary conditions and different covering methods, and the model can still accurately and reliably represent the dynamic characteristics of the original system after using the joint step-down method. Under different excitation signals and different boundary conditions, the LQR control can effectively suppress the vibration of the sandwich plate. The optimal cover position of the sandwich plate is near the solid support end and far from the free-degree end. The parameters of controller parameters and viscoelastic layer thickness are optimized from several angles, respectively, and a reasonable optimization scheme can be selected according to the actual requirements.",

        "content": "The presence of submicrometer structures at liquid-fluid interfaces modifies the properties of many science and technological systems by lowering the interfacial tension, creating tangential Marangoni stresses, and/or inducing surface viscoelasticity. Here we experimentally study the break-up of a liquid filament of a silica nanoparticle dispersion in a background oil phase that contains surfactant assemblies. Although self-similar power-law pinch-off is well documented for threads of Newtonian fluids, we report that when a viscoelastic layer is formed in situ at the interface, the pinch-off dynamics follows an exponential decay. Recently, such exponential neck thinning was found theoretically when surface viscous effects were taken into account. We introduce a simple approach to calculate the effective relaxation time of viscoelastic interfaces and estimate the thickness of the interfacial layer and the viscoelastic properties of liquid-fluid interfaces, where the direct measurement of interfacial rheology is not possible.",

Based on the finite element method and Golla-Hughes-McTavish (GHM) model, the system dynamics equation is established. Models are simplified in physical and modal space because of unobservable and uncontrollable. Based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) feedback gain was optimized. The effect of system vibration damping under different controller parameters, piezoelectric-constrained layer position and excitation signal was studied. The study show that the optimal feedback gain of the controller can effectively balance the control effect and the control cost. The closer the piezoelectric layer and viscoelastic layer are to the fixed end, the better the system control effect and the smaller the control cost. The reduced-order model has a good control effect on different excitation signals.",

        "content": "Proteins are widely used in the formation and stabilization of multiphase systems, thanks to their ability to adsorb at the interface reducing the interfacial tension and promoting the formation of viscoelastic layers. Owing to the growing consumer demand, the food industry is moving toward the growing use of plant-based proteins, suitable for consumers who do not eat products of animal origin, for either ethical or health reasons. Nevertheless, the scientific literature lacks information on the surface activity and emulsifying ability of these proteins. In this work, the interfacial properties of soy, hemp and brown rice isolate proteins were investigated at the interface with commercial sunflower oil (O/W) to evaluate their characteristics in view of potential uses in food applications such as emulsions, sauces, dressing, topping and soft foods. Dilatational and shear kinematic, with pendant drop and magnetic rod techniques, respectively, were used. The dilatational analysis was performed in static and dynamic conditions, to obtain the equilibrium adsorption isotherms and the rheological parameters of the interfacial layers under both oscillation and stress relaxation. The interfaces were studied in shear conditions with small amplitude oscillations and creep tests. The obtained results evidenced that all tested proteins are able to build a strong viscoelastic layer with properties comparable to those of animal proteins. Brown rice protein seems particularly effective in reducing the interfacial tension even if shear tests evidence that the interface is weaker than that obtained using hemp or soy protein. Hemp protein seems very promising for potential practical uses yielding intermediate interfacial tensions and strong viscoelastic layers.",

        "content": "Viscoelastic material can significantly reduce the vibration energy and radiated noise of a structure, so it is widely used in lightweight sandwich structures. The accurate and efficient determination of the frequency-dependent complex modulus of viscoelastic material is the basis for the correct analysis of the vibro-acoustic behavior of sandwich structures. Based on the behavior of a sandwich beam whose core is a viscoelastic layer, a combined theoretical and experimental study is proposed to characterize the properties of the viscoelastic layer constituting the core. In this method, the viscoelastic layer is bonded between two constraining layers. Then, a genetic algorithm is used to fit the analytical solution of the frequency¬ response function of the free-free constrained beam to the measured result, and then the frequency-dependent complex modulus is estimated for the viscoelastic layer. Moreover, by varying the length of the beams, it is possible to characterize the frequency-dependent complex modulus of the viscoelastic material over a wide frequency range. Finally, the characterized frequency-dependent complex modulus is imported into a finite element model to compute the complex natural frequencies of a sandwich beam, and a comparison of the simulated and measured results displays that the errors in the real parts are within 2.33% and the errors in the imaginary parts are within 3.31%. It is confirmed that the proposed method is feasible, accurate, and reliable. This provides essential technical support for improving the acoustic vibration characteristics of sandwich panels by introducing viscoelastic materials.",

        "title": "Dynamic responses of a damaged double Euler-Bernoulli beam traversed by a 'phantom' vehicle.",
        "content": "In this paper, the dynamic response of a damaged double-beam system traversed by a moving load is studied, including passive control using multiple tuned mass dampers. The double-beam system is composed of two homogeneous isotropic Euler-Bernoulli beams connected by a viscoelastic layer. The damaged upper beam is simulated using a double-sided open crack replaced by an equivalent rotational spring between two beam segments, and the lower primary beam is subjected to a moving load. The load is represented by a moving Dirac delta function and by a quarter car model, respectively. Road surface roughness (RSR) is classified as per ISO 8606:1995(E). The effect of vehicle speed of the moving oscillator and variable RSR profiles on the dynamics of this damaged double Euler-Bernoulli beam system for different crack-depth ratios (CDRs) at various crack locations is studied. It is observed that coupling of two beams leads to a vehicular effect on the damaged beam, even when no vehicle on it is present. The effects of single and multiple tuned mass dampers to control the vibrational responses of the primary beam due to damage on the secondary beam is studied next. The performance of tuned mass dampers to reduce the transverse vibrations of the damaged double-beam system and of the quarter car is investigated. The paper links the coupling between the two levels of double beam with the inertial coupling of the vehicle to the double-beam system.",

        "content": "To investigate the potential applications of bio-based epoxy resins across diverse fields, this study synthesized a bio-based epoxy resin using itaconic acid (EIA) as the precursor material and compared its thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties with those of epoxy acrylate (EA). The findings indicate that the glass transition temperature and the 5% thermal decomposition temperature of the EIA-cured system are higher than those of EA. The breakdown field strength of the EIA-cured system is slightly higher than that of EA (35.58 kV/mm), suggesting that EIA exhibits stronger electrical properties compared to EA. Mechanical property tests demonstrate that the tensile strength, elongation at the fracture point, and Shore hardness of the EIA-cured system are superior to those of EA. In conclusion, EIA, serving as a matrix resin, is influenced by cross-linking density and intramolecular ester bonding and exhibits close electrical strength but superior mechanical, thermal, and degradation properties than EA.",

        "content": "Nowadays, convectional metallic material replaced by composite materials, because composite materials have superior than metallic materials properties such as light weights, higher strength-to-weight ratio, high tensile strength, Low cost, greater design flexibility, better fatigue resistance, renewability, and biodegradability. These properties of composite material are the most basic & common attractive features that make them useful for industrial applications. The main objective of this work is to contribute for a better understanding of the static behavior of structure made from fiber reinforced composite materials, specifically for the case of plate structures. The plate model is created using SOLIDWORKS 2017 and then imported into ANSYS R18.1. The study specifically examines three stacking sequences of the composite plate (angle ply, cross ply, and multidirectional ply) to analysis stress and deformation resulted from the loads. The static analysis of a Carbon/Epoxy with honeycomb plate composite reveals that the equivalent stress and deformation are lower in the cross-ply stacking sequence compared to the angle ply and multidirectional ply for the same load carrying capacity. This suggests that the composite plate with a cross ply configuration is more suitable for manufacturing composite structures due to its improved performance.",

        "publishedDate": "2019-05-21T03:17:43",
        "content": "Composites of direct-spun carbon nanotube (CNT) mats and epoxy are manufactured and tested in order to determine their mechanical and electrical properties. The mats are spun directly from a floating catalyst, chemical vapour deposition reactor. The volume fraction of epoxy is varied widely by suitable dilution of the epoxy resin with acetone. Subsequent evaporation of the acetone, followed by a cure cycle, leads to composites of varying volume fraction of CNT, epoxy and air. The modulus, strength, electrical conductivity and piezoresistivity of the composites are measured. The CNT mats and their composites exhibit an elastic-plastic stress-strain response under uniaxial tensile loading, and the degree of anisotropy is assessed by testing specimens in 0{\\deg}, 45{\\deg} and 90{\\deg} directions with respect to the draw direction of mat manufacture. The electrical conductivity scales linearly with CNT volume fraction, irrespective of epoxy volume fraction. In contrast, the modulus and strength depend upon both CNT and epoxy volume fractions in a non-linear manner. The macroscopic moduli of the CNT mat-epoxy composites are far below the Voigt bound based on the modulus of CNT walls and epoxy. A micromechanical model is proposed to relate the macroscopic modulus and yield strength of a CNT mat-epoxy composite to the microstructure.",

        "title": "[Identification of conservation and restoration materials for iron relics through ultraviolet-induced visible luminescence imaging and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry].",
        "content": "Understanding the previous protection and restoration efforts and the current state of cultural relics is essential before compiling a conservation and restoration plan. The lack of detailed archival records for some early conservation operations, the identification of restoration materials necessitates the use of scientific analytical methods. In this study, the composition and spatial distribution of historical restoration materials on five iron relics were investigated through pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and ultraviolet-induced visible luminescence imaging (UVL). The relics studied were iron weight 20791, iron adze head 2335, and iron axe 2334 from the Gansu Provincial Museum, iron sword D0008 from the Zhaotong Municipal Museum, and iron sword 450 from the National Museum of China. All five relics had undergone restoration without accompanying archival records. UVL revealed the distribution of various conservation materials. Notably, two distinct layers of the conservation material were observed on iron axe 2334. Differences in the fluorescence color and intensity of iron sword 450 provided information regarding the sampling strategy. The samples were collected under ultraviolet light emitting diode illumination to ensure representativeness and minimize damage to the relics. Through Py-GC/MS, the coating materials for iron weight 20791 and iron adze head 2335 were identified as boiled tung oil mixed with rosin resin. Iron axis 2334 had a two-layer coating: a base layer of boiled tung oil and a top layer of shellac. The coating material for iron sword D0008 was determined to be paraffin wax. The protective layer of iron sword 450 included multiple materials, including shellac, polystyrene, and bisphenol-A-type epoxy resin. This study confirms that UVL combined with Py-GC/MS serves as an effective technique for analyzing historical restoration materials. UVL guided the selection of representative samples for Py-GC/MS, reducing the time and amount of sampling required and minimizing further damage to the relics. This research provides valuable data for the restoration archives of five iron artifacts, offering a scientific basis for conservators to evaluate conservation methods, devise future conservation strategies, and exclude ineffective conservation materials.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-12-12T10:39:00",
        "content": "Epoxy polymers are used in wide range of applications. The properties and performance of epoxy polymers depend upon various factors like the type of constituents and their proportions used and other process parameters. The conventional way of developing epoxy polymers is usually labor-intensive and may not be fully efficient, which has resulted in epoxy polymers having a limited performance range due to the use of predetermined blend combinations, compositions and development parameters. Hence, in order to experiment with more design parameters, robust and easy computational techniques need to be established. To this end, we developed and analyzed in this study a new machine learning (ML) based approach to predict the mechanical properties of epoxy polymers based on their basic structural features. The results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to derive the ML model. The salient feature of our work is that for the development of epoxy polymers based on EPON-862, several new hardeners were explored in addition to the conventionally used ones. The influence of additional parameters like the proportion of curing agent used and the extent of curing on the mechanical properties of epoxy polymers were also investigated. This method can be further extended by providing the epoxy polymer with the desired properties through knowledge of the structural characteristics of its constituents. The findings of our study can thus lead toward development of efficient design methodologies for epoxy polymeric systems.",

        "publishedDate": "2022-01-10T18:37:35",
        "content": "In this work, we demonstrate that use of dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent leads to better dispersion of graphene nanoplatelets in epoxy matrix compared to acetone solvent, in turn leading to higher thermal conductivity epoxy-graphene nanocomposites. While role of solvents in enabling superior mechanical properties has been addressed before, outlined study is the first to address the effect of solvents on thermal conductivity enhancement and provides novel pathways for achieving high thermal conductivity polymer composite materials. Uniform dispersion of graphene nanoparticles into epoxy can improve thermal contact with polymer leading to superior interface thermal conductance between polymer matrix and graphene. Organic solvents are typically employed to achieve efficient dispersion of graphene into the epoxy matrix. In this study, we compare the effect of two organic solvents, dimethylformamide (DMF) and acetone, in terms of their efficiency in dispersing graphene into the epoxy matrix and their effect on enhancing thermal conductivity of the composite. We find that polymer-graphene composites made with DMF solvent show 44% higher thermal conductivity compared to those made using acetone at 7 weight% filler composition. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) imaging reveals that graphene-epoxy composites, prepared using DMF as solvent, exhibit more uniform dispersion of graphene-nanoplatelets compared to the case of acetone with acetone-based samples exhibiting up to 211% larger graphene agglomerations. Comparison with effective medium theory reveals an almost 35% lower interface thermal resistance between graphene and epoxy for DMF relative to acetone prepared composite. These results provide fundamentally new avenues to achieve higher thermal conductivity graphene-epoxy composites, of key importance for a wide range of thermal management technologies.",

The chapter explains how the formation of epoxy resins was invented and introduced to the market. A great variety of such resins and monographs is available on the market. The specialties and the method of manufacturing these epoxy resins are elaborately explained in this chapter. There are many special additives used in the formation of the material to enhance and strengthen it for all conditions. The epoxide group reacts with several substance classes. Only a few of the possible reactions are used for curing in practice. Mechanical properties of epoxy resins can be correlated and traced back to the constituting monomers. The recycling of wastes of epoxy resins is very difficult and the most efficient methods are identified. For fulfilling this purpose, many effective applications, usages, and special formulations are given.",

The addition of BE resulted in an increase in Tg in all tested blends. Blends with 50 wt% BE cured with TETA demonstrated an increase in flexural modulus and flexural strength, while preserving the elongation. Blends with 40 wt% BE cured with PEA4 and 50 wt% BE cured with DDS resulted in a significant enhanced tensile elongation. The shear strength of all cured systems decreased moderately with the addition of BE exhibiting a mixed mode failure. Analysis of the fracture morphology using electron microscopy supported the increase of toughness levels as a result of incorporating BE to conventional epoxy. A unique nodular and rough fracture morphology was obtained, which is related to a toughening mechanism caused by the addition of BE. It was concluded that blends of BE and conventional epoxy could be used as structural adhesives having high Tg, enhanced mechanical properties and increased toughness. POLYM. ENG.

However, their use in demanding tribological applications such as, in sliding components of machines, are known to be limited. This is often attributed to their low load bearing capacity combined with poor thermal stability under severe p-v regimes. Researchers have tried to enhance the tribological properties of the epoxy coatings using a combination of several types of micro/nano sized fillers to produce composite or hybrid composite coatings. Hence, this review paper aims to focus on the recent advances made in developing the epoxy coating systems. Special attention would be paid to the types and properties of nano-fillers that have been commonly used to develop these coatings, different dispersion techniques adopted and the effects that each of these fillers (and their combinations) have on the tribological properties of these coatings.",

Interpretation of the scientific measurements made using these instruments depends on accurate calibration of the instruments' performance. Updates to the instrument calibrations achieved during the Deep Impact primary mission and results of continued monitoring of their performance during EPOXI are reported here. The instruments' performance has remained remarkably stable over the nearly 7 years of flight. Significant improvements in the understanding and calibration of the IR spectrometer response non-linearity, time-varying background level, flat field, wavelength map, and absolute spectral response have been achieved. Techniques for reducing some semi-coherent horizontal noise stripes in the visible cameras' readouts were developed, and some adjustments have been made to their absolute radiometric conversion constants. The data processing pipeline has been updated to incorporate the improvements in the instrument calibrations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Depending on the number of pumps, it allows to compress of various air amounts inside and thus changing the airflow pressure. For air stream pressure tests, three pumps were taken, resulting in air pressure of 17.03 bars. The sample was connected to the input of Keysight DSOX 3104T oscilloscope with an impedance of 1 MΩ, which allows for measurement of the output voltage of the sample. Keysight DSOX 3104T oscilloscope was connected to a PC with dedicated software installed. Finger tapping tests were also performed using plexiglass plate and Keysight DSOX 3104T oscilloscope, while for vibration response analysis Dynalabs DYN-PM-20 permanent magnet shaker with different accelerations and oscilloscope were used.",

        "content": "Epoxy resins have a wide range of applications, including in corrosion protection of metals, electronics, structural adhesives, and composites. The consumption of epoxy resins is predicted to keep growing in the coming years. Unfortunately, thermoset resins cannot be recycled, and are typically not biodegradable. Hence, they pose environmental pollution risk. Here, we report degradation of epoxy resin by two bacteria that are capable of using epoxy resin as a sole carbon source. These bacteria were isolated from soil samples collected from areas around an epoxy and polyurethanes manufacturing plant. Using an array of molecular, biochemical, analytical, and microscopic techniques, they were identified as Rhodococcus rhodochrous and Ochrobactrum anthropi. As epoxy was the only carbon source available for these bacteria, their measured growth rate reflected their ability to degrade epoxy resin. Bacterial growth took place only when the two bacteria were grown together, indicating a synergistic effect. The surface morphology of the epoxy droplets changed significantly due to the biodegradation process. The metabolic pathway of epoxy by these two microbes was investigated by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Bisphenol A, 3,3′-((propane-2,2-diylbis(4,1-phenylene))bis(oxy))bis(propane-1,2-diol) and some other constituents were identified as being consumed by the bacteria.",

The values of the piezoelectric factors obtained are slightly higher than those of neat piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride. The composites respond rapidly and reach a saturation voltage output, to the application of mechanical stimulus quickly. The composites are promising for the creation of bulk piezoelectric devices, different from the usual stretched films, exploiting the physic-chemical a of the epoxy matrix.

        "publishedDate": "2021-08-02T14:26:14",
        "content": "Epoxy resins are used extensively in composite materials for a wide range of engineering applications, including structural components of aircraft and spacecraft. The processing of fiber-reinforced epoxy composite structures requires carefully selected heating and cooling cycles to fully cure the resin and form strong crosslinked networks. To fully optimize the processing parameters for effective epoxy monomer crosslinking and final product integrity, the evolution of mechanical properties of epoxies during processing must be comprehensively understood. Because the full experimental characterization of these properties as a function of the degree of cure is difficult and time-consuming, efficient computational predictive tools are needed. The objective of this research is to develop an experimentally validated Molecular Dynamics (MD) modeling method, which incorporates a reactive force field, to accurately predict the thermo-mechanical properties of an epoxy resin as a function of the degree of cure. Experimental rheometric and mechanical testing are used to validate an MD model which is subsequently used to predict mass density, shrinkage, elastic properties, and yield strength as a function of the degree of cure. The results indicate that each of the physical and mechanical properties evolve uniquely during the crosslinking process. These results are important for future processing modeling efforts.",

This work presents integrated investigations of the lignocellulosic date palm/epoxy composites at various reinforcement condition parameters for sustainable structural materials where elemental mapping, topological analysis, and mechanical performance have been performed. Mapping energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was utilized to assess the composite composition properly. Elemental mapping and a scanning electron microscope were employed to evaluate the chemical composition of the composites. The mechanical performance of the produced composites was also explored in terms of ultimate tensile strength, tensile modulus, elongation at break, and impact energy properties. The effects of fiber loading, fiber length, and fiber width (as long fiber, short fiber, and long-thin fiber) were investigated for the date palm fiber/epoxy composites. Results have revealed that the composite behavior was affected by several influential reinforcement parameters. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy maps by C-K, O-K, Si-K, K-K, and Ca-K demonstrated that the composites contain mainly carbon, silicon, and oxygen. It was evident that the modulus of elasticity property of short fiber composites exhibits an increasing trend with higher fiber content, even at 35 wt%. Moreover, the enhancement of tensile strength for the short fiber size composites reached 72.5 %. However, such tensile strength of thin fiber size/epoxy composites achieved 135.7 % at 25 wt% indicating superior development of this mechanical property. The long date palm fiber composites demonstrated the best value of modulus of elasticity and the maximum impact energy of 15.3 kJ/m",

        "content": "A series of recyclable epoxy resin (REP) composites are successfully prepared in this study, aiming to improve flame retardancy while keep good recyclability and mechanical properties. The commercial 9,10-Dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene 10-Oxide (DOPO) with high reactive P-H bond is used as highly-efficient flame retardant in this work. Compared with pure epoxy resin with a limited oxygen index of 21.7 % and no rating in vertical burning test, recyclable epoxy resin only with 3 wt% DOPO acquires a limited oxygen index value of 27.8% and V-0 rating. In addition, REP composites containing 4 wt% DOPO displays quick self-extinguishing behavior, which shows the 43.5% drop of the peak heat release rate. The main reason might be that traditional phosphorous-containing flame retardant existing in REP composites can play a positive role in both condensed phase and gas phase when burning. On the other hand, both scanning electron microscopy and Raman results also further affirm the improved flame retardancy. Moreover, flame-retardant REP composites can also maintain good transparency and mechanical properties. As well as the favorable recyclability originated from the special exchangeable disulfide crosslinks. High-Performance REP composites possessing expected flame retardancy, recyclability and good mechanical properties pave the way to broaden applications of thermoset epoxy materials.",

        "content": "Decoctions of Ferula orientalis L. (Apiaceae), have been traditionally used to lower blood glucose levels (BGLs). After in vitro enzyme inhibition tests on the dichloromethane extracts of the roots (FOD) and the methanol extract of the roots (FOM), isolation studies were carried out on the FOD extract. The anti-hyperglycemic effects of the FOD extract and the pure compounds were studied in mice using the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) models. Molecular docking studies were performed on potent compounds in the binding pockets of enzymes α-glucosidase and α-amylase. The isolations of 11 compounds were isolated from the FOD extract, which comprised teferidine (1), ferutinin (FT) (2), teferin (3), epoxy-jaeschkeanadiol-p-hydroxybenzoate (4), epoxy-jaeschkeanadiol-6-vanillate (5), tovarol-8-angelate (6), leucoferin (7), tovarol-8-p-hydroxybenzoate (8), tovarol-8-vanillate (9), 6-β-p-hydroxybenzoyloxy-germacra-1(10),4-diene (10), and chimgin (11). Compounds 2 and 8-11 exhibited a higher inhibitory activity on α-glucosidase. In the OGTT, pretreatment with the FOD extract or compound 2 did not alter the BGLs after administration of the glucose solution compared to the control. In the STZ-induced diabetic mice model, no significant difference in the BGLs was observed with the FOD extract (200 mg/kg) or compound 2 (100 mg/kg)-treated diabetic mice compared to the diabetic control mice. The experimental studies all showed that the F. orientalis extract had significant effects on the enzyme systems involved in DM, and it would be appropriate to plan further studies on possible problems of bioavailability of the compound FT and the FOD extract, inadequate dose, and duration of administration.",

However, established polymeric beads are made of thermoplastics, deform and melt beyond their temperature services. In this manuscript, a new technique is proposed to fabricate expandable epoxy beads (EEBs), then expand and fuse them to produce epoxy particle foams (EPFs). This technique is called solid-state carbamate foaming technique. For production of EEBs, a mixture of epoxy, carbamate and hardener is prepared and poured into a 10 mL syringe. The mixture is manually extruded into 60 °C water to obtain a cylindric shape. The extrudate is then further cured to obtain an epoxy oligomer behaving rheological tan delta 3 and 2 at 60 °C. The extrudate is cut into pellets to obtain EEBs. The EEBs are then loaded into an aluminum mold and placed in an oven at 160 °C to expand, fuse to obtain EPFs of 212 kg/m3 and 258 kg/m3. The obtained EPFs provide a Tg of 150–154 °C. The fusion boundaries in EPFs are well formed. Thus, the produced EPFs exhibit a compressive modulus of 50–70 MPa, with a torsion storage modulus at 30 °C of 34–56 MPa.",

        "content": "To evaluate the fracture load of bilayer ceramic crowns manufactured by Rapid Layer Technology (RLT) after different cementation protocols of the veneering ceramic to the zirconia infrastructures. Sixty epoxy resin preparations simulating a molar tooth were obtained and 60 zirconia infrastructures and feldspathic crowns were manufactured by RLT and divided into 6 groups according to the cementation protocol at the interface to veneering ceramic (n=10): Ctr- control: conventional resin cement; Al- Al2O3 sandblasting 50µm + conventional resin cement; Al/MDP- Al2O3 sandblasting (50µm) + resin cement with MDP; Sil- silicatization 30µm + conventional resin cement; Gl/HF- glaze + hydrofluoridric acid (5%,60s) + silane + conventional resin cement; Gl- glazing as bonding agent. The feldspathic ceramic internal surface was etched with fluoridric acid (5%) + silane followed by cementation according to respective protocols. All samples were mechanically cycled (200N and 4.5x105 Pa, 37°C, 2x106 cycles, 3.4Hz) and submitted to axial compressing fracture load test (10kN, 0.5mm/min). The results(N) were submitted to descriptive and analytical statistical analysis with 1-way ANOVA, Weibull, and the Tukey test (α=0.05). ANOVA revealed that there was a significant difference among the tested groups (p<0.0001). The group Al/MDP presented the higher resistance to fracture (1972.46A N), followed by the Ctr group (1584.41B N). The characteristic strength(σ0) was significantly different (p=0.000). The crack and chipping were the predominant failures. The air-abrasion at the external surface of zirconia with Al2O3 followed by cementation with MDP resin cement, should be selected to Rapid Layer Technique when felspathic ceramic is used as veneer ceramic.",

        "publishedDate": "2018-10-01T16:34:20",
        "content": "This work presents a method to produce structural composites capable of energy storage. They are produced by integrating thin sandwich structures of CNT fiber veils and an ionic liquid-based polymer electrolyte between carbon fiber plies, followed by infusion and curing of an epoxy resin. The resulting structure behaves simultaneously as an electric double-layer capacitor and a structural composite, with flexural modulus of 60 GPa and flexural strength of 153 MPa, combined with 88 mF/g of specific capacitance and the highest power (30 W/kg) and energy (37.5 mWh/kg) densities reported so far for structural supercapacitors. In-situ electrochemical measurements during 4-point bending show that electrochemical performance is retained up to fracture, with minor changes in equivalent series resistance for interleaves under compressive stress. En route to improving interlaminar properties we produce grid-shaped interleaves that enable mechanical interconnection of plies by the stiff epoxy. Synchrotron 3D X-ray tomography analysis of the resulting hierarchical structure confirms the formation of interlaminar epoxy joints. The manuscript discusses encapsulation role of epoxy, demonstrated by charge-discharge measurements of composites immersed in water, a deleterious agent for ionic liquids. Finally, we show different architectures free of current collector and electrical insulators, in which both CNT fiber and CF act as active electrodes.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-05-28T06:54:43",
        "content": "Averting the effects of anthropogenic climate change requires a transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon technology. A way to achieve this is to decarbonize the electricity grid. However, further efforts must be made in other fields such as transport and heating for full decarbonization. This would reduce carbon emissions due to electricity generation, and also help to decarbonize other sources such as automotive and heating by enabling a low-carbon alternative. Carbon taxes have been shown to be an efficient way to aid in this transition. In this paper, we demonstrate how to to find optimal carbon tax policies through a genetic algorithm approach, using the electricity market agent-based model ElecSim. To achieve this, we use the NSGA-II genetic algorithm to minimize average electricity price and relative carbon intensity of the electricity mix. We demonstrate that it is possible to find a range of carbon taxes to suit differing objectives. Our results show that we are able to minimize electricity cost to below \\textsterling10/MWh as well as carbon intensity to zero in every case. In terms of the optimal carbon tax strategy, we found that an increasing strategy between 2020 and 2035 was preferable. Each of the Pareto-front optimal tax strategies are at least above \\textsterling81/tCO2 for every year. The mean carbon tax strategy was \\textsterling240/tCO2.",

The WMFO aims to prevent local trapping of moths, fostering improved global search capabilities. Demonstrating a remarkable efficiency of 66.6 %, WMFO outperforms the MFO on CEC15 benchmark test functions. The Friedman and Wilcoxon tests further confirm WMFO's superiority over state-of-the-art algorithms. Introducing a hybrid model, WMFO-MLP, combining WMFO with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), facilitates effective parameter tuning for carbon emission prediction, achieving an outstanding total accuracy of 97.8 %. Comparative analysis indicates that the MLP-WMFO model surpasses alternative techniques in precision, reliability, and efficiency. Feature importance analysis reveals that variables such as Oil Efficiency and Economic Growth significantly impact MLP-WMFO's predictive power, contributing up to 40 %. Additionally, Gas Efficiency, Renewable Energy, Financial Risk, and Political Risk explain 26.5 %, 13.6 %, 8 %, and 6.5 %, respectively. Finally, WMFO-MLP performance offers advancements in optimization and predictive modeling with practical applications in carbon emission prediction.",

        "content": "Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) moves atmospheric carbon to geological or land-based sinks. In a first-best setting, the optimal use of CDR is achieved by a removal subsidy that equals the optimal carbon tax and marginal damages. We derive second-best policy rules for CDR subsidies and carbon taxes when no global carbon price exists but a national government implements a unilateral climate policy. We find that the optimal carbon tax differs from an optimal CDR subsidy because of carbon leakage and a balance of resource trade effect. First, the optimal removal subsidy tends to be larger than the carbon tax because of lower supply-side leakage on fossil resource markets. Second, net carbon exporters exacerbate this wedge to increase producer surplus of their carbon resource producers, implying even larger removal subsidies. Third, net carbon importers may set their removal subsidy even below their carbon tax when marginal environmental damages are small, to appropriate producer surplus from carbon exporters.",

Robotic surgery improves safety and precision but its cost-effectiveness limits widespread use. Augmented reality can enhance screw placement accuracy and efficiency, yet requires refinement in precision and user interaction. Three-dimensional printing, through personalized guides and implants, optimizes surgical procedures, though further clinical studies are needed to validate long-term benefits. New implant designs and materials, facilitated by topological optimization, carbon fiber composite polyetheretherketone, present opportunities for creating anatomically and biomechanically congruent spinal implants.

We use a general equilibrium model with non-homothetic preferences and an elaborate setup of the residential housing and energy production sector. In the first-best transition, the energy demand plays only a secondary role. However, this changes when optimal carbon taxes are not available. While providing subsidies for retrofits results in the lowest direct costs for households, it ultimately leads to the highest aggregate costs and proves to be an ineffective way to decarbonize the economy.

        "content": "We investigate optimal carbon abatement in a dynamic general equilibrium climate-economy model with endogenous structural change. By differentiating the production of investment from consumption, we show that social cost of carbon can be conceived as a reduction in physical capital. In addition, we distinguish two final sectors in terms of productivity growth and climate vulnerability. We theoretically show that heterogeneous climate vulnerability results in a climate-induced version of Baumol's cost disease. Further, if climate-vulnerable sectors have high (low) productivity growth, climate impact can either ameliorate (aggravate) the Baumol's cost disease, call for less (more) stringent climate policy. We conclude that carbon abatement should not only factor in unpriced climate capital, but also be tailored to Baumol's cost and climate diseases.",

        "content": "Given China's rapid industrial upgrade and economic development process, this study tries to explore the effect of industrial structure transformation on carbon emissions in China and the moderating effect of financial development by employing the traditional OLS model, the dynamic SYS-GMM model, and the dynamic spatial lag model comprehensively. In particular, industrial structure transformation has been divided into two indicators including industrial structure rationalization and industrial structure optimization; carbon emissions are evaluated from the dual perspective of scale and average. The empirical results indicate that only industrial structure optimization has a negative impact on carbon emissions scale in China at the national level. In addition, financial development has merely and positively moderated the nexus between industrial structure rationalization and carbon emissions scale and per capital carbon emission in the southern regions of China, which highlights the establishment of regional heterogeneity and the necessity of formulating policy in line with local conditions. Both theoretical and practical significance have drawn from this study, for the emerging economics and in particular for China, to reduce carbon emissions through industrial structure transformation and financial development and promote high-quality development in the new era.",

        "content": "A swirled fluidized bed chemical vapour deposition (SFCVD) reactor has been manufactured and optimized to produce carbon nanostructures on a continuous basis using in situ formation of floating catalyst particles by thermal decomposition of organometallic ferrocene. During the process optimization, carbon nanoballs were produced in the absence of a catalyst at temperatures higher than 1000 degrees C, while carbon nanofibres, single-walled carbon nanotubes, helical carbon nanotubes, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and carbon nanofibres (CNFs) were produced in the presence of a catalyst at lower temperatures of between 750 and 900 degrees C. The optimum conditions for producing carbon nanostructures were a temperature of 850 degrees C, acetylene flow rate of 100 ml min(-1), and acetylene gas was used as the carbon source. All carbon nanostructures produced have morphologies and diameters ranging from 15 to 200 nm and wall thicknesses between 0.5 and 0.8 nm. In comparison to the quantity of MWCNTs produced with other methods described in the literature, the SFCVD technique was superior to floating catalytic CVD (horizontal fixed bed) and microwave CVD but inferior to rotary tube CVD.",

Amongst various sodium-based electrode materials, NaFePO4 is one of the most promising cathodic material because of its high electrochemical potential, structural, and thermal stability. To use this material in high performance Na-ion based energy storage device, it is imperative to combine it with a suitably optimized carbon structures and a redox additive modified electrolyte. This strategy is unequivocally established in the paper. On addition of redox additive, the performance can be improved by 50%.

        "publishedDate": "2022-10-10T18:41:56",
        "content": "Cloud platforms' rapid growth is raising significant concerns about their carbon emissions. To reduce emissions, future cloud platforms will need to increase their reliance on renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, which have zero emissions but are highly unreliable. Unfortunately, today's energy systems effectively mask this unreliability in hardware, which prevents applications from optimizing their carbon-efficiency, or work done per kilogram of carbon emitted. To address this problem, we design an \"ecovisor\", which virtualizes the energy system and exposes software-defined control of it to applications. An ecovisor enables each application to handle clean energy's unreliability in software based on its own specific requirements. We implement a small-scale ecovisor prototype that virtualizes a physical energy system to enable software-based application-level i) visibility into variable grid carbon-intensity and renewable generation and ii) control of server power usage and battery charging/discharging. We evaluate the ecovisor approach by showing how multiple applications can concurrently exercise their virtual energy system in different ways to better optimize carbon-efficiency based on their specific requirements compared to a general system-wide policy.",

        "content": "To combat global warming and mitigate the risks associated with climate change, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has emerged as a crucial technology. However, safely sequestering CO2 in geological formations for long-term storage presents several challenges. In this study, we address these issues by modeling the decision-making process for carbon storage operations as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We solve the POMDP using belief state planning to optimize injector and monitoring well locations, with the goal of maximizing stored CO2 while maintaining safety. Empirical results in simulation demonstrate that our approach is effective in ensuring safe long-term carbon storage operations. We showcase the flexibility of our approach by introducing three different monitoring strategies and examining their impact on decision quality. Additionally, we introduce a neural network surrogate model for the POMDP decision-making process to handle the complex dynamics of the multi-phase flow. We also investigate the effects of different fidelity levels of the surrogate model on decision qualities.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-08-24T21:11:55",
        "content": "Today's cloud data centers are often distributed geographically to provide robust data services. But these geo-distributed data centers (GDDCs) have a significant associated environmental impact due to their increasing carbon emissions and water usage, which needs to be curtailed. Moreover, the energy costs of operating these data centers continue to rise. This paper proposes a novel framework to co-optimize carbon emissions, water footprint, and energy costs of GDDCs, using a hybrid workload management framework called SHIELD that integrates machine learning guided local search with a decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm. Our framework considers geographical factors and time-based differences in power generation/use, costs, and environmental impacts to intelligently manage workload distribution across GDDCs and data center operation. Experimental results show that SHIELD can realize 34.4x speedup and 2.1x improvement in Pareto Hypervolume while reducing the carbon footprint by up to 3.7x, water footprint by up to 1.8x, energy costs by up to 1.3x, and a cumulative improvement across all objectives (carbon, water, cost) of up to 4.8x compared to the state-of-the-art.",

When switching to a newer device with upgraded functions, therapy completely failed. A video recording performed by the patient's wife showed high frequency mask movements suggesting inability to maintain a therapeutic pressure with high frequency pressure fluctuations, confirmed afterwards during full night polysomnography and in a bench study. CPAP manufacturers may put on the market new devices with supposedly better algorithms that in fact may have escaped serious pre-marketing evaluation and that may jeopardize the efficacy of a well proven treatment. We suggest that better evaluations are necessary before marketing therapeutic devices, and that post-marketing assessment of unanticipated side effects should become the norm.",

Optical frequency comb technique provides a significant bridge to transfer the stability between optical frequency and radio frequency. The advances of this technology greatly promote the development of precision spectroscopy, optical time/frequency transfer, optical frequency division, long-distance transfer of time/frequency references and high-precision distance measurement. Benefiting from the wide spectral outputs, femtosecond lasers have become the best choice for the fulfillment of optical frequency combs. Within the precise control of the repetition frequency and carrier-envelope offset frequency of the pulse train from femtosecond lasers, a stable optical frequency comb both in the time domain and frequency domain can be obtained.

        "publishedDate": "2024-07-04T15:46:01",
        "content": "Ensuring the robustness of computer vision models against adversarial attacks is a significant and long-lasting objective. Motivated by adversarial attacks, researchers have devoted considerable efforts to enhancing model robustness by adversarial training (AT). However, we observe that while AT improves the models' robustness against adversarial perturbations, it fails to improve their ability to effectively extract features across all frequency components. Each frequency component contains distinct types of crucial information: low-frequency features provide fundamental structural insights, while high-frequency features capture intricate details and textures. In particular, AT tends to neglect the reliance on susceptible high-frequency features. This low-frequency bias impedes the model's ability to effectively leverage the potentially meaningful semantic information present in high-frequency features. This paper proposes a novel module called High-Frequency Feature Disentanglement and Recalibration (HFDR), which separates features into high-frequency and low-frequency components and recalibrates the high-frequency feature to capture latent useful semantics. Additionally, we introduce frequency attention regularization to magnitude the model's extraction of different frequency features and mitigate low-frequency bias during AT. Extensive experiments showcase the immense potential and superiority of our approach in resisting various white-box attacks, transfer attacks, and showcasing strong generalization capabilities.",

        "content": "Pan-sharpening involves reconstructing missing high-frequency information in multi-spectral images with low spatial resolution, using a higher-resolution panchromatic image as guidance. Although the inborn connection with frequency domain, existing pan-sharpening research has not almost investigated the potential solution upon frequency domain. To this end, we propose a novel Frequency Adaptive Mixture of Experts (FAME) learning framework for pan-sharpening, which consists of three key components: the Adaptive Frequency Separation Prediction Module, the Sub-Frequency Learning Expert Module, and the Expert Mixture Module. In detail, the first leverages the discrete cosine transform to perform frequency separation by predicting the frequency mask. On the basis of generated mask, the second with low-frequency MOE and high-frequency MOE takes account for enabling the effective low-frequency and high-frequency information reconstruction. Followed by, the final fusion module dynamically weights high-frequency and low-frequency MOE knowledge to adapt to remote sensing images with significant content variations. Quantitative and qualitative experiments over multiple datasets demonstrate that our method performs the best against other state-of-the-art ones and comprises a strong generalization ability for real-world scenes.

        "publishedDate": "2024-04-16T00:58:46",
        "content": "Enhancing our understanding of adversarial examples is crucial for the secure application of machine learning models in real-world scenarios. A prevalent method for analyzing adversarial examples is through a frequency-based approach. However, existing research indicates that attacks designed to exploit low-frequency or high-frequency information can enhance attack performance, leading to an unclear relationship between adversarial perturbations and different frequency components. In this paper, we seek to demystify this relationship by exploring the characteristics of adversarial perturbations within the frequency domain. We employ wavelet packet decomposition for detailed frequency analysis of adversarial examples and conduct statistical examinations across various frequency bands. Intriguingly, our findings indicate that significant adversarial perturbations are present within the high-frequency components of low-frequency bands. Drawing on this insight, we propose a black-box adversarial attack algorithm based on combining different frequency bands. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets and models demonstrate that combining low-frequency bands and high-frequency components of low-frequency bands can significantly enhance attack efficiency. The average attack success rate reaches 99\\%, surpassing attacks that utilize a single frequency segment. Additionally, we introduce the normalized disturbance visibility index as a solution to the limitations of $L_2$ norm in assessing continuous and discrete perturbations.",

In situ frequency tuning and impedance matching of the resonator circuit using voltage-tunable capacitors (varactors) is needed to optimize read-out sensitivity, but the performance of conventional semiconductor- and ferroelectric-based varactors degrades substantially in the millikelvin temperature range relevant for solid-state quantum devices. Here we show that strontium titanate and potassium tantalate, materials which can exhibit quantum paraelectric behaviour with large field-tunable permittivity at low temperatures, can be used to make varactors with perfect impedance matching and resonator frequency tuning at 6 mK. We characterize the varactors at 6 mK in terms of their capacitance tunability, dissipative losses and magnetic field insensitivity. We use the quantum paraelectric varactors to optimize the radiofrequency read-out of carbon nanotube quantum dot devices, achieving a charge sensitivity of 4.8 μ",

        "content": "In this paper, we propose a novel time-frequency joint learning method for speech emotion recognition, called Time-Frequency Transformer. Its advantage is that the Time-Frequency Transformer can excavate global emotion patterns in the time-frequency domain of speech signal while modeling the local emotional correlations in the time domain and frequency domain respectively. For the purpose, we first design a Time Transformer and Frequency Transformer to capture the local emotion patterns between frames and inside frequency bands respectively, so as to ensure the integrity of the emotion information modeling in both time and frequency domains. Then, a Time-Frequency Transformer is proposed to mine the time-frequency emotional correlations through the local time-domain and frequency-domain emotion features for learning more discriminative global speech emotion representation. The whole process is a time-frequency joint learning process implemented by a series of Transformer models. Experiments on IEMOCAP and CASIA databases indicate that our proposed method outdoes the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-08-01T09:13:35",
        "content": "By combining traditional frequency hopping ideas with the concepts of subcarriers and sampling points in OFDM baseband systems, this paper proposes a frequency hopping technology within the baseband called micro frequency hopping. Based on the concept of micro frequency hopping, this paper proposes a micro frequency hopping spread spectrum modulation method based on cyclic frequency shift and cyclic time shift, as well as a micro frequency hopping encryption method based on phase scrambling of baseband signals. Specifically, this paper reveals a linear micro frequency hopping symbol with good auto-correlation and cross-correlation feature in both time domain and frequency domain. Linear micro frequency hopping symbols with different root $R$ have good cross-correlation feature, which can be used in multi-user communication at same time and same frequency. Moreover, there is a linear relationship between the time delay and frequency offset of this linear micro frequency hopping symbol, making it suitable for time delay and frequency offset estimation, also for ranging, and speed measurement. Finally, this paper also verifies the advantages of micro frequency hopping technology through an example of a linear micro frequency hopping spread spectrum multiple access communication system. The author believes that micro frequency hopping technology will be widely used in fields such as the Internet of Things, military communication, satellite communication, satellite positioning, and radar etc.",

        "content": "2D convolution is widely used in sound event detection (SED) to recognize two dimensional time-frequency patterns of sound events. However, 2D convolution enforces translation equivariance on sound events along both time and frequency axis while frequency is not shift-invariant dimension. In order to improve physical consistency of 2D convolution on SED, we propose frequency dynamic convolution which applies kernel that adapts to frequency components of input. Frequency dynamic convolution outperforms the baseline by 6.3% in DESED validation dataset in terms of polyphonic sound detection score (PSDS). It also significantly outperforms other pre-existing content-adaptive methods on SED. In addition, by comparing class-wise F1 scores of baseline and frequency dynamic convolution, we showed that frequency dynamic convolution is especially more effective for detection of non-stationary sound events with intricate time-frequency patterns. From this result, we verified that frequency dynamic convolution is superior in recognizing frequency-dependent patterns.",

        "content": "To meet the requirements of time-frequency networks and enable frequency downloadability for nodes along the link, we demonstrated the extraction of stable frequency signals at nodes using a mode-locked laser under the condition of 100 km laboratory fiber. The node consists of a simple structure that utilizes widely used optoelectronic devices and enables plug-and-play applications. In addition, the node can recover frequency signals with multiple frequencies, which are useful for scenarios that require different frequencies. Here, we experimentally demonstrated a short-term frequency instability of $2.83\\times {{10}^{-13}}$@1 s and a long-term frequency instability of $1.18\\times {{10}^{-15}}$@10,000 s at the node, which is similar to that at the remote site of the frequency transfer system. At the same time, frequency signals with different frequencies also achieved stable extraction with the same performance at the node. Our results can support the distributed application under large-scale time-frequency networks.",

        "publishedDate": "2016-05-09T22:23:54",
        "content": "Self-referencing turns pulsed laser systems into self-referenced frequency combs. Such frequency combs allow counting of optical frequencies and have a wide range of applications. The required optical bandwidth to implement self-referencing is typically obtained via nonlinear broadening in optical fibers. Recent advances in the field of Kerr frequency combs have provided a path towards the development of compact frequency comb sources that provide broadband frequency combs, exhibit microwave repetition rates and that are compatible with on-chip photonic integration. These devices have the potential to significantly expand the use of frequency combs. Yet to date self-referencing of such Kerr frequency combs has only been attained by applying conventional, fiber based broadening techniques. Here we demonstrate external broadening-free self-referencing of a Kerr frequency comb. An optical spectrum that spans two-thirds of an octave is directly synthesized from a continuous wave laser-driven silicon nitride microresonator using temporal dissipative Kerr soliton formation and soliton Cherenkov radiation. Using this coherent bandwidth and two continuous wave transfer lasers in a 2f-3f self-referencing scheme, we are able to detect the offset frequency of the soliton Kerr frequency comb. By stabilizing the repetition rate to a radio frequency reference the self-referenced frequency comb is used to count and track the continuous wave pump laser's frequency. This work demonstrates the principal ability of soliton Kerr frequency combs to provide microwave-to-optical clockworks on a chip.",

In particular, we provide a representation-theoretic framework for interleavings, showing that the category of interleavings under a fixed translation is isomorphic to the representation category of what we call a shoelace. Using our framework, we show that any two interleavings of the same pair of persistence modules are themselves interleaved. Furthermore, in the special case of persistence modules over $\\mathbb{Z}$, we show that matchings between barcodes correspond to the interval-decomposable interleavings.",

        "content": "In this work, echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) with flyback readout gradient-echo train was implemented in a preclinical MR scanner. The aim of this study is to visualize and quantify the ghost spectral lines produced by two, three and four interleaved echo trains with different amplitudes of the readout gradients, and to investigate the feasibility of the flyback data acquisition in micro-imaging of small animals. Applied multi-slice EPSI sequence utilizes asymmetric gradient-echo train that combines the shortest possible rewind gradients with readout gradients. It simplifies data processing because all echoes are acquired with the same polarity of the readout gradient. The approach with four interleaved gradient-echo trains and with four echoes in each train provides broad spectral bandwidth in combination with narrow receiver bandwidth and a good water-fat signal separation. It improves signal-to-noise ratio without the undesired consequence of water-fat shift artifacts that are eliminated during data processing. Position, number, and intensity of the ghost spectral lines can be controlled by the suitable choice of spectral bandwidth, number of echo train interleaves, and the number of echoes in each interleave. This study demonstrates that high-spatial resolution EPSI with interleaved flyback readout gradient-echo trains is feasible on standard preclinical scanners.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-06-01T22:55:35",
        "content": "Merge trees, contour trees, and Reeb graphs are graph-based topological descriptors that capture topological changes of (sub)level sets of scalar fields. Comparing scalar fields using their topological descriptors has many applications in topological data analysis and visualization of scientific data. Recently, Munch and Stefanou introduced a labeled interleaving distance for comparing two labeled merge trees, which enjoys a number of theoretical and algorithmic properties. In particular, the labeled interleaving distance between merge trees can be computed in polynomial time. In this work, we define the labeled interleaving distance for labeled Reeb graphs. We then prove that the (ordinary) interleaving distance between Reeb graphs equals the minimum of the labeled interleaving distance over all labelings. We also provide an efficient algorithm for computing the labeled interleaving distance between two labeled contour trees (which are special types of Reeb graphs that arise from simply-connected domains). In the case of merge trees, the notion of the labeled interleaving distance was used by Gasparovic et al. to prove that the (ordinary) interleaving distance on the set of (unlabeled) merge trees is intrinsic. As our final contribution, we present counterexamples showing that, on the contrary, the (ordinary) interleaving distance on (unlabeled) Reeb graphs (and contour trees) is not intrinsic. It turns out that, under mild conditions on the labelings, the labeled interleaving distance is a metric on isomorphism classes of Reeb graphs, analogous to the ordinary interleaving distance. This provides new metrics on large classes of Reeb graphs.",

        "title": "An Interleaving Distance for Ordered Merge Trees",
        "publishedDate": "2023-12-18T11:21:58",
        "content": "Merge trees are a common topological descriptor for data with a hierarchical component, such as terrains and scalar fields. The interleaving distance, in turn, is a common distance measure for comparing merge trees. However, the interleaving distance for merge trees is solely based on the hierarchical structure, and disregards any other geometrical or topological properties that might be present in the underlying data. Furthermore, the interleaving distance is NP-hard to compute. In this paper, we introduce a form of ordered merge trees that does capture intrinsic order present in the data. We further define a natural variant of the interleaving distance, the monotone interleaving distance, which is an order preserving distance measure for ordered merge trees. Analogous to the regular interleaving distance for merge trees, we show that the monotone variant has three equivalent definitions in terms of two maps, a single map, or a labelling. The labelling-based definition fairly directly leads to an efficient algorithm for computing the monotone interleaving distance, but unfortunately it computes only an approximation thereof. Instead, we discover a surprising connection between the monotone interleaving distance of ordered merge trees and the Fr\\'{e}chet distance of 1D curves. As a result, the monotone interleaving distance between two ordered merge trees of total complexity $n$ can be computed exactly in $\\tilde O(n^2)$ time. The connection between the monotone interleaving distance and the Fr\\'{e}chet distance establishes a new bridge between the fields of computational topology/topological data analysis, where interleaving distances are studied extensively, and computational geometry, where Fr\\'{e}chet distances are studied extensively.",

        "content": "Using acoustic vortex tweezers (AVT) to spatially accumulate microbubbles (MBs) shows promise for enhancing drug delivery efficiency and reducing off-target effects. The strong echogenicity of accumulated MBs also improves diagnostics via conventional ultrasound (US) B-mode imaging. However, the annular high-pressure distribution of AVT inhibits MBs inflow at the inlet, reducing MBs collection. The spatial resolution of US B-mode imaging further limits theranostic applications of AVT-mediated MBs accumulation. To address these challenges, we integrated an AVT waveform with volumetric super-resolution imaging (VSRI) to monitor the dynamic growth of MBs cluster during accumulation. We used a 5-MHz 2D array transducer for VSRI, employing plane wave pulses interleaved with accumulating pulses to retain MBs at a flow rate of 0.023-0.047 mL/s in a 3-mm vessel phantom. An asymmetrical AVT waveform (AVT*) was produced by modulating the pressure at the MBs inlet compared to the outlet. The effectiveness was validated in rat cerebral vessels for real-time volumetric tracking of MBs clusters. Microscopy observations showed that AVT* could quickly gather flowing MBs into cluster without repelling them at a flow rate of 0.023 mL/s. Statistical results indicated that microscopic data correlated better with VSRI than with B-mode images, suggesting VSRI suffices to detect the dynamics of AVT*-actuated MBs accumulation in real-time. Additionally, VSRI detected a significant increase in MBs cluster size over time during AVT* in the superior sagittal sinus of the rat brain. These findings demonstrate that the proposed strategy can accumulate the flowing MBs at a desired location and simultaneously observe this phenomenon.",

        "title": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Evaluation and Classification of Vascular Malformations.",
        "content": "Introduction Vascular malformations of the soft tissues are a diverse collection of lesions frequently encountered in clinical practice. Vascular malformations are rare and complex abnormalities that affect both children and young adults. Low-flow malformations are more common in children and often become symptomatic in later years. These malformations are common causes of soft tissue masses in children and can affect any part of the body at any age. Significant advancements in the management of these conditions have been made due to the implementation of a comprehensive binary categorization system, which classifies vascular abnormalities into tumors and malformations based on their clinicopathological characteristics. Imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plays a crucial role in the accurate identification, localization, and classification of these lesions, aiding in the development of appropriate treatment plans. Materials and methods This prospective study was conducted at Dr. D. Y. Patil Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, Pimpri, Pune, from August 2022 to June 2024. Fifty patients of all age groups with clinically suspected soft tissue vascular malformations were included. MRI was performed using a MAGNETOM Vida (3T) Scanner (Siemens Healthcare Private Limited, Mumbai, India), and ultrasound was used as an adjunct. Institutional Ethics Committee clearance and informed consent were obtained. The study employed various MRI sequences, including T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) fast spin echo (FSE), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) FSE, short tau inversion recovery (STIR), T2-weighted gradient recalled echo (GRE), pre-contrast fat-saturated T1WI, 3D post-contrast T1WI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and ANGIO TWIST (time-resolved angiography with interleaved stochastic trajectories) ISO. Results The study included 50 patients, with a male predominance of 28 (56%). The mean age was 22.13 years, and the average duration of vascular malformations was 32.94 months. The swelling was present in 43 (86%) of patients, and 35 (70%) had superficial lesions. MRI findings revealed hypointensity on T1 imaging in 40 (80%) patients and hyperintensity on T2 imaging in 49 (98%) cases. STIR sequences showed hyperintensity in all patients. The most common type of vascular malformation was slow-flow 46 (92%), with venous malformations being the most prevalent 39 (78%). Conclusion MRI is a valuable imaging modality for the evaluation and classification of vascular malformations, providing detailed information on lesion extent and involvement of surrounding tissues. The findings support the use of MRI as a primary tool in the assessment of vascular malformations, with ultrasound serving as a useful adjunct in certain cases. Further studies with larger sample sizes are recommended to validate these findings and refine imaging protocols.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-04-29T16:05:45",
        "content": "The interleaving distance, although originally developed for persistent homology, has been generalized to measure the distance between functors modeled on many posets or even small categories. Existing theories require that such a poset have a superlinear family of translations or a similar structure. However, many posets of interest to topological data analysis, such as zig-zag posets and the face relation poset of a cell-complex, do not admit interesting translations, and consequently don't admit a nice theory of interleavings. In this paper we show how one can side-step this limitation by providing a general theory where one maps to a poset that does admit interesting translations, such as the lattice of down sets, and then defines interleavings relative to this map. Part of our theory includes a rigorous notion of discretization or \"pixelization\" of poset modules, which in turn we use for interleaving inference. We provide an approximation condition that in the setting of lattices gives rise to two possible pixelizations, both of which are guaranteed to be close in the interleaving distance. Finally, we conclude by considering interleaving inference for cosheaves over a metric space and give an explicit description of interleavings over a grid structure on Euclidean space.",

        "content": "Eukaryotic genomes are pervasively transcribed but until recently this noncoding transcription was considered to be simply noise. Noncoding transcription units overlap with genes and genes overlap other genes, meaning genomes are extensively interleaved. Experimental interventions reveal high degrees of interdependency between these transcription units, which have been co-opted as gene regulatory mechanisms. The precise outcome depends on the relative orientation of the transcription units and whether two overlapping transcription events are contemporaneous or not, but generally involves chromatin-based changes. Thus transcription itself regulates transcription initiation or repression at many regions of the genome.",

Analyzing and discussing existing problems and proposals for corresponding countermeasures should be carried out periodically. Objective Investigate and understand the main factors that affect the development of tactical training activities of big football teams. Methods Large-scale soccer match tactics at the 2018 World Cup are evaluated and treated statistically by dividing the defensive behaviors in the game between individual defensive tactics and collective defensive tactics. Results The primary means of launching a fast defensive attack is a medium to long pass across the court. Launching a fast attack requires combining a pass with a sudden attack. Conclusion Attackers often take the initiative in their confrontation tactics. The aggressive style of the players excels in the initiative and midfield advantage.

        "content": "Musical interval identification is a valuable skill for holistic and sophisticated musicianship. Yet, discriminating and identifying intervals is often challenging, especially for musical novices. Drawing on cognitive psychological principles, we built two experiments that investigated the utility of interleaving in enhancing novices’ aural identification of melodic ascending intervals. Specifically, we designed a novel programmed intervention during which novices learnt six interval types in an interleaved schedule (different interval types learnt interspersed) and six interval types in a blocked schedule (each interval type drilled several times before proceeding to the next) within a single session. When implemented in combination with familiar reference songs and singing as supplementary learning aids, interleaving and blocking yielded comparable performance on a test requiring participants to classify novel instances of the studied interval types (Experiment 1). However, in the absence of reference songs and singing, a robust interleaving effect emerged—interleaving produced superior musical interval identification than blocking (Experiment 2). Yet, most participants were unaware of the benefits of interleaving, and misjudged blocking to be more effective. These findings highlight the potential influence of context under which interleaving is a beneficial technique for learning melodic musical intervals.",

Across a 4-week period, ninth- through 12th-grade students (N = 155) took a weekly quiz in their science courses that tested half of the concepts taught that week. Questions on each quiz were either blocked by concept or interleaved with different concepts. A month after the final quiz, students were tested on the concepts covered in the 4-week period. Replicating the retrieval-practice effect, results showed that participants performed better on concepts that had been on blocked quizzes (M = 54%, SD = 28%) than on concepts that had not been quizzed (M = 47%, SD = 20%; d = 0.30). Interleaved quizzes led to even greater benefits: Participants performed better on concepts that had been on interleaved quizzes (M = 63%, SD = 26%) than on concepts that had been on blocked quizzes (d = 0.35).

        "content": "The interleaving distance for persistence modules, originally defined by Chazal et al., is arguably the most powerful, generalizable mathematical idea to come out of TDA in the last decade. The categorification of persistence modules and the related interleaving distance provided a plug-and-play system to create new metrics for functors with a poset category domain. In this talk, we will generalize this work even further to give a definition of the interleaving distance for a category with a flow; that is, a category $C$ with a functor $S:\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq0} \\to \\mathrm{End}(C)$ which satisfies certain compatibility conditions. From this framework, we can see that many commonly used metrics, such as the Hausdorff distance on sets and the $\\ell_\\infty$ distance on $\\R^n$ are all examples of interleaving distances. The categorical viewpoint gives an immediate construction for a host of stability theorems. Further, a new construction on elements of a category with a flow called a hom-tree provides a lower bound for the interleaving distance. This work is joint with Anastasios Stefanou and Vin de Silva.",

        "content": "We examined neural mechanisms associated with the learning of novel morphologically derived words in native Hebrew speakers within the Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) framework. Across four sessions, 28 participants were trained on an artificial language, which included two types of morphologically complex words: linear (root + suffix) with a salient structure, and non-linear (root interleaved with template), with a prominent derivational structure in participants' first language (L1). A third simple monomorphemic condition, which served as baseline, was also included. On the first and fourth sessions, training was followed by testing in an fMRI scanner. Our behavioural results showed decomposition of both types of complex words, with the linear structure more easily learned than the non-linear structure. Our fMRI results showed involvement of frontal areas, associated with decomposition, only for the non-linear condition, after just the first session. We also observed training-related increases in activation in temporal areas specifically for the non-linear condition, which was correlated with participants' L1 morphological awareness. These results demonstrate that morphological decomposition of derived words occurs in the very early stages of word learning, is influenced by L1 experience, and can facilitate word learning. However, in contrast to the CLS framework, we found no support for a shift from reliance on hippocampus to reliance on cortical areas in any of our conditions. Instead, our findings align more closely with recent theories showing a positive correlation between changes in hippocampus and cortical areas, suggesting that these representations co-exist and continue to interact with one another beyond initial learning.",

It also studies a family of n-ary interleaving operations, one for each arity n, which act on an ordered set $(X_0, X_1, ..., X_{n-1})$ of one-sided symbol sequences on a finite alphabet A, to produce a set $X$ of all output sequences obtained by interleaving the symbols of words $x_i$ in each $X_i$ in arithmetic progressions (mod n). It studies a set of closure operations relating interleaving and decimation. It reviews basic algorithmic results on presentations of path sets and existence of a minimal right-resolving presentation. It gives an algorithm for computing presentations of decimations of path sets from presentations of path sets, showing the minimal right-resolving presentation of $\\psi_{j,n}(X)$ has at most one more vertex than a minimal right-resolving presentation of X. It shows that a path set has only finitely many distinct decimations. It shows the class of path sets on a fixed alphabet is closed under all interleaving operations, and gives algorithms for computing presentations of n-fold interleavings of given sets $X_i$. It studies interleaving factorizations and classifies path sets that have infinite interleaving factorizations, and gives an algorithm to recognize them. It shows a finiteness of a process of iterated interleaving factorizations, which \"freezes\" factors that have infinite interleavings.",

        "title": "HER4 is a high-affinity dimerization partner for all EGFR/HER/ErbB family proteins.",
        "content": "Human epidermal growth factor receptors (HER)-also known as EGFR or ErbB receptors-are a subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that play crucial roles in cell growth, division, and differentiation. HER4 (ErbB4) is the least studied member of this family, partly because its expression is lower in later stages of development. Recent work has suggested that HER4 can play a role in metastasis by regulating cell migration and invasiveness; however, unlike EGFR and HER2, the precise role that HER4 plays in tumorigenesis is still unresolved. Early work on HER family proteins suggested that there are direct interactions between the four members, but to date, there has been no single study of all four receptors in the same cell line with the same biophysical method. Here, we quantitatively measure the degree of association between HER4 and the other HER family proteins in live cells with a time-resolved fluorescence technique called pulsed interleaved excitation fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (PIE-FCCS). PIE-FCCS is sensitive to the oligomerization state of membrane proteins in live cells, while simultaneously measuring single-cell protein expression levels and diffusion coefficients. Our PIE-FCCS results demonstrate that HER4 interacts directly with all HER family members in the cell plasma membrane. The interaction between HER4 and other HER family members intensified in the presence of a HER4-specific ligand. Our work suggests that HER4 is a preferred dimerization partner for all HER family proteins, even in the absence of ligands.",

        "content": "As a step towards establishing homotopy-theoretic foundations for topological data analysis (TDA), we introduce and study homotopy interleavings between filtered topological spaces. These are homotopy-invariant analogues of interleavings, objects commonly used in TDA to articulate stability and inference theorems. Intuitively, whereas a strict interleaving between filtered spaces $X$ and $Y$ certifies that $X$ and $Y$ are approximately isomorphic, a homotopy interleaving between $X$ and $Y$ certifies that $X$ and $Y$ are approximately weakly equivalent. The main results of this paper are that homotopy interleavings induce an extended pseudometric $d_{HI}$ on filtered spaces, and that this is the universal pseudometric satisfying natural stability and homotopy invariance axioms. To motivate these axioms, we also observe that $d_{HI}$ (or more generally, any pseudometric satisfying these two axioms and an additional \"homology bounding\" axiom) can be used to formulate lifts of several fundamental TDA theorems from the algebraic (homological) level to the level of filtered spaces. Finally, we consider the problem of establishing a persistent Whitehead theorem in terms of homotopy interleavings. We provide a counterexample to a naive formulation of the result.",

        "content": "Independent control of electromagnetic (EM) waves by metasurfaces for multiple tasks are highly desired and is the recent hot topic of research. In this work we contribute a polarization insensitive frequency multiplexed 2-bit coding metasurface to control the Terahertz (THz) waves in the two operating bands independently. In this regard, as a first step a cascaded meta-atom composed of square rings and/or square metallic patches separated by two polyimide substrates is designed and optimized that provides sixteen independent distinct discrete phases in the reflection geometry. These meta-atoms are then distributed with distinct coding sequences in the two-dimensional spatial plane to realize various bi-functional metasurfaces. As a proof of the concept various full structures are designed and simulated to realize a series of bi-functionalities including anomalous reflection/beam shaping, beam shaping/anomalous reflection, beam deflection/Orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam generation with distinct modes and propagating wave to surface wave (PW-SW) conversion/PW beam manipulation in the lower and higher THz bands, respectively. All the simulation results are in excellent agreement with their theoretical equivalents. We envision that the proposed meta-designs have potential applications for the multi-spectral control of EM waves in THz band. The idea can be further extended to design frequency dependent tri-functional and multi-functional THz meta-devices.",

        "publishedDate": "2021-03-12T00:54:22",
        "content": "Interleaving learning is a human learning technique where a learner interleaves the studies of multiple topics, which increases long-term retention and improves ability to transfer learned knowledge. Inspired by the interleaving learning technique of humans, in this paper we explore whether this learning methodology is beneficial for improving the performance of machine learning models as well. We propose a novel machine learning framework referred to as interleaving learning (IL). In our framework, a set of models collaboratively learn a data encoder in an interleaving fashion: the encoder is trained by model 1 for a while, then passed to model 2 for further training, then model 3, and so on; after trained by all models, the encoder returns back to model 1 and is trained again, then moving to model 2, 3, etc. This process repeats for multiple rounds. Our framework is based on multi-level optimization consisting of multiple inter-connected learning stages. An efficient gradient-based algorithm is developed to solve the multi-level optimization problem. We apply interleaving learning to search neural architectures for image classification on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The effectiveness of our method is strongly demonstrated by the experimental results.",

        "content": "Due to the recent challenges in post-quantum cryptography, several new approaches for code-based cryptography have been proposed. For example, a variant of the McEliece cryptosystem based on interleaved codes was proposed. In order to deem such new settings secure, we first need to understand and analyze the complexity of the underlying problem, in this case the problem of decoding a random interleaved code. A simple approach to decode such codes, would be to randomly choose a vector in the row span of the received matrix and run a classical information set decoding algorithm on this erroneous codeword. In this paper, we propose a new generic decoder for interleaved codes, which is an adaption of the classical idea of information set decoding by Prange and perfectly fits the interleaved setting. We then analyze the cost of the new algorithm and a comparison to the simple approach described above shows the superiority of Interleaved Prange.",

        "content": "We all possess a mental library of schemas that specify how different types of events unfold. How are these schemas acquired? A key challenge is that learning a new schema can catastrophically interfere with old knowledge. One solution to this dilemma is to use interleaved training to learn a single representation that accommodates all schemas. However, another class of models posits that catastrophic interference can be avoided by splitting off new representations when large prediction errors occur. A key differentiating prediction is that, according to splitting models, catastrophic interference can be prevented even under blocked training curricula. We conducted a series of semi-naturalistic experiments and simulations with Bayesian and neural network models to compare the predictions made by the \"splitting\" versus \"non-splitting\" hypotheses of schema learning. We found better performance in blocked compared to interleaved curricula, and explain these results using a Bayesian model that incorporates representational splitting in response to large prediction errors. In a follow-up experiment, we validated the model prediction that inserting blocked training early in learning leads to better learning performance than inserting blocked training later in learning. Our results suggest that different learning environments (i.e., curricula) play an important role in shaping schema composition.",

        "content": "We consider decoding of vertically homogeneous interleaved sum-rank-metric codes with high interleaving order $s$, that are constructed by stacking $s$ codewords of a single constituent code. We propose a Metzner--Kapturowski-like decoding algorithm that can correct errors of sum-rank weight $t <= d-2$, where $d$ is the minimum distance of the code, if the interleaving order $s > t$ and the error matrix fulfills a certain rank condition. The proposed decoding algorithm generalizes the Metzner--Kapturowski(-like) decoders in the Hamming metric and the rank metric and has a computational complexity of $\\tilde{O}(\\max(n^3, n^2 s))$ operations in $\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$, where $n$ is the length of the code. The scheme performs linear-algebraic operations only and thus works for any interleaved linear sum-rank-metric code. We show how the decoder can be used to decode high-order interleaved codes in the skew metric. Apart from error control, the proposed decoder allows to determine the security level of code-based cryptosystems based on interleaved sum-rank metric codes.",

To improve the radiosity solution, a method that performs shooting and gathering in an interleaving manner is proposed in the paper. Besides, a criterion has been set up and tested for choosing object elements used in the gathering operation, and a criterion is established to quantify the solution errors by taking into account more reasonably of the human perception of the radiosity solution. Experimental results show that the method proposed has nice performance in improving the radiosity solution.",

        "publishedDate": "2019-05-21T03:17:43",
        "content": "Composites of direct-spun carbon nanotube (CNT) mats and epoxy are manufactured and tested in order to determine their mechanical and electrical properties. The mats are spun directly from a floating catalyst, chemical vapour deposition reactor. The volume fraction of epoxy is varied widely by suitable dilution of the epoxy resin with acetone. Subsequent evaporation of the acetone, followed by a cure cycle, leads to composites of varying volume fraction of CNT, epoxy and air. The modulus, strength, electrical conductivity and piezoresistivity of the composites are measured. The CNT mats and their composites exhibit an elastic-plastic stress-strain response under uniaxial tensile loading, and the degree of anisotropy is assessed by testing specimens in 0{\\deg}, 45{\\deg} and 90{\\deg} directions with respect to the draw direction of mat manufacture. The electrical conductivity scales linearly with CNT volume fraction, irrespective of epoxy volume fraction. In contrast, the modulus and strength depend upon both CNT and epoxy volume fractions in a non-linear manner. The macroscopic moduli of the CNT mat-epoxy composites are far below the Voigt bound based on the modulus of CNT walls and epoxy. A micromechanical model is proposed to relate the macroscopic modulus and yield strength of a CNT mat-epoxy composite to the microstructure.",

        "content": "Nowadays, convectional metallic material replaced by composite materials, because composite materials have superior than metallic materials properties such as light weights, higher strength-to-weight ratio, high tensile strength, Low cost, greater design flexibility, better fatigue resistance, renewability, and biodegradability. These properties of composite material are the most basic & common attractive features that make them useful for industrial applications. The main objective of this work is to contribute for a better understanding of the static behavior of structure made from fiber reinforced composite materials, specifically for the case of plate structures. The plate model is created using SOLIDWORKS 2017 and then imported into ANSYS R18.1. The study specifically examines three stacking sequences of the composite plate (angle ply, cross ply, and multidirectional ply) to analysis stress and deformation resulted from the loads. The static analysis of a Carbon/Epoxy with honeycomb plate composite reveals that the equivalent stress and deformation are lower in the cross-ply stacking sequence compared to the angle ply and multidirectional ply for the same load carrying capacity. This suggests that the composite plate with a cross ply configuration is more suitable for manufacturing composite structures due to its improved performance.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-12-12T10:39:00",
        "content": "Epoxy polymers are used in wide range of applications. The properties and performance of epoxy polymers depend upon various factors like the type of constituents and their proportions used and other process parameters. The conventional way of developing epoxy polymers is usually labor-intensive and may not be fully efficient, which has resulted in epoxy polymers having a limited performance range due to the use of predetermined blend combinations, compositions and development parameters. Hence, in order to experiment with more design parameters, robust and easy computational techniques need to be established. To this end, we developed and analyzed in this study a new machine learning (ML) based approach to predict the mechanical properties of epoxy polymers based on their basic structural features. The results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to derive the ML model. The salient feature of our work is that for the development of epoxy polymers based on EPON-862, several new hardeners were explored in addition to the conventionally used ones. The influence of additional parameters like the proportion of curing agent used and the extent of curing on the mechanical properties of epoxy polymers were also investigated. This method can be further extended by providing the epoxy polymer with the desired properties through knowledge of the structural characteristics of its constituents. The findings of our study can thus lead toward development of efficient design methodologies for epoxy polymeric systems.",

        "title": "[Identification of conservation and restoration materials for iron relics through ultraviolet-induced visible luminescence imaging and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry].",
        "content": "Understanding the previous protection and restoration efforts and the current state of cultural relics is essential before compiling a conservation and restoration plan. The lack of detailed archival records for some early conservation operations, the identification of restoration materials necessitates the use of scientific analytical methods. In this study, the composition and spatial distribution of historical restoration materials on five iron relics were investigated through pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and ultraviolet-induced visible luminescence imaging (UVL). The relics studied were iron weight 20791, iron adze head 2335, and iron axe 2334 from the Gansu Provincial Museum, iron sword D0008 from the Zhaotong Municipal Museum, and iron sword 450 from the National Museum of China. All five relics had undergone restoration without accompanying archival records. UVL revealed the distribution of various conservation materials. Notably, two distinct layers of the conservation material were observed on iron axe 2334. Differences in the fluorescence color and intensity of iron sword 450 provided information regarding the sampling strategy. The samples were collected under ultraviolet light emitting diode illumination to ensure representativeness and minimize damage to the relics. Through Py-GC/MS, the coating materials for iron weight 20791 and iron adze head 2335 were identified as boiled tung oil mixed with rosin resin. Iron axis 2334 had a two-layer coating: a base layer of boiled tung oil and a top layer of shellac. The coating material for iron sword D0008 was determined to be paraffin wax. The protective layer of iron sword 450 included multiple materials, including shellac, polystyrene, and bisphenol-A-type epoxy resin. This study confirms that UVL combined with Py-GC/MS serves as an effective technique for analyzing historical restoration materials. UVL guided the selection of representative samples for Py-GC/MS, reducing the time and amount of sampling required and minimizing further damage to the relics. This research provides valuable data for the restoration archives of five iron artifacts, offering a scientific basis for conservators to evaluate conservation methods, devise future conservation strategies, and exclude ineffective conservation materials.",

        "publishedDate": "2022-01-10T18:37:35",
        "content": "In this work, we demonstrate that use of dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent leads to better dispersion of graphene nanoplatelets in epoxy matrix compared to acetone solvent, in turn leading to higher thermal conductivity epoxy-graphene nanocomposites. While role of solvents in enabling superior mechanical properties has been addressed before, outlined study is the first to address the effect of solvents on thermal conductivity enhancement and provides novel pathways for achieving high thermal conductivity polymer composite materials. Uniform dispersion of graphene nanoparticles into epoxy can improve thermal contact with polymer leading to superior interface thermal conductance between polymer matrix and graphene. Organic solvents are typically employed to achieve efficient dispersion of graphene into the epoxy matrix. In this study, we compare the effect of two organic solvents, dimethylformamide (DMF) and acetone, in terms of their efficiency in dispersing graphene into the epoxy matrix and their effect on enhancing thermal conductivity of the composite. We find that polymer-graphene composites made with DMF solvent show 44% higher thermal conductivity compared to those made using acetone at 7 weight% filler composition. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) imaging reveals that graphene-epoxy composites, prepared using DMF as solvent, exhibit more uniform dispersion of graphene-nanoplatelets compared to the case of acetone with acetone-based samples exhibiting up to 211% larger graphene agglomerations. Comparison with effective medium theory reveals an almost 35% lower interface thermal resistance between graphene and epoxy for DMF relative to acetone prepared composite. These results provide fundamentally new avenues to achieve higher thermal conductivity graphene-epoxy composites, of key importance for a wide range of thermal management technologies.",

        "publishedDate": "2021-08-02T14:26:14",
        "content": "Epoxy resins are used extensively in composite materials for a wide range of engineering applications, including structural components of aircraft and spacecraft. The processing of fiber-reinforced epoxy composite structures requires carefully selected heating and cooling cycles to fully cure the resin and form strong crosslinked networks. To fully optimize the processing parameters for effective epoxy monomer crosslinking and final product integrity, the evolution of mechanical properties of epoxies during processing must be comprehensively understood. Because the full experimental characterization of these properties as a function of the degree of cure is difficult and time-consuming, efficient computational predictive tools are needed. The objective of this research is to develop an experimentally validated Molecular Dynamics (MD) modeling method, which incorporates a reactive force field, to accurately predict the thermo-mechanical properties of an epoxy resin as a function of the degree of cure. Experimental rheometric and mechanical testing are used to validate an MD model which is subsequently used to predict mass density, shrinkage, elastic properties, and yield strength as a function of the degree of cure. The results indicate that each of the physical and mechanical properties evolve uniquely during the crosslinking process. These results are important for future processing modeling efforts.",

        "content": "The value of biomaterials for green products has begun to develop more ecofriendly and renewable sustainable materials for a better circular economy and to reduce carbon footprints. This work presents integrated investigations of the lignocellulosic date palm/epoxy composites at various reinforcement condition parameters for sustainable structural materials where elemental mapping, topological analysis, and mechanical performance have been performed. Mapping energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was utilized to assess the composite composition properly. Elemental mapping and a scanning electron microscope were employed to evaluate the chemical composition of the composites. The mechanical performance of the produced composites was also explored in terms of ultimate tensile strength, tensile modulus, elongation at break, and impact energy properties. The effects of fiber loading, fiber length, and fiber width (as long fiber, short fiber, and long-thin fiber) were investigated for the date palm fiber/epoxy composites. Results have revealed that the composite behavior was affected by several influential reinforcement parameters. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy maps by C-K, O-K, Si-K, K-K, and Ca-K demonstrated that the composites contain mainly carbon, silicon, and oxygen. It was evident that the modulus of elasticity property of short fiber composites exhibits an increasing trend with higher fiber content, even at 35 wt%. Moreover, the enhancement of tensile strength for the short fiber size composites reached 72.5 %. However, such tensile strength of thin fiber size/epoxy composites achieved 135.7 % at 25 wt% indicating superior development of this mechanical property. The long date palm fiber composites demonstrated the best value of modulus of elasticity and the maximum impact energy of 15.3 kJ/m",

        "publishedDate": "2017-05-12T09:17:02",
        "content": "We present an analytical study of oscillatory laminar shear flow over a compliant viscoelastic layer on a rigid base. This problem relates to oscillating blood flow in viscoelastic vessels. The deeper motivation for this study, however, is the possible use of compliant coatings for turbulent drag reduction. An analytical solution of the fluid and solid velocity is presented, and five dimensionless parameters emerge. The interaction between fluid and solid appears to be determined by a single combined dimensionless parameter, which we call the shear interaction parameter $\\chi$. The fluid satisfies a no-slip boundary condition when $\\left|\\chi\\right| \\rightarrow 0$, which occurs when the solid is heavy, stiff and/or thin. In contrast, the fluid obeys a free-slip boundary condition when $\\left|\\chi\\right| \\rightarrow \\infty$, which corresponds to a lightweight and/or soft solid. Three types of resonance modes are identified for an elastic solid. Two modes (odd and even) are specific to the solid. The third mode results from the coupling with the fluid. The three modes are less pronounced or even absent for a viscoelastic solid. These findings have a twofold use. First, they help to understand the fluid and solid dynamics when shear coupling is important. Second, the presented analytical solution is very useful for validation of numerical fluid-structure-interaction solvers. Future work might include the extension of the theory to multiple viscoelastic layers and the dynamic coupling of normal stresses.",

        "content": "We consider a cylinder immersed in viscous fluid moving near a flat substrate covered by an incompressible viscoelastic fluid layer, and study the effect of the fluid viscoelasticity on the lift force exerted on the cylinder. The lift force is zero when the viscoelastic layer is not deformed, but becomes non-zero when it is deformed. We calculate the lift force by considering both the tangential stress and the normal stress applied at the surface of the viscoelastic layer. Our analysis indicates that as the layer changes from the elastic limit to the viscous limit, the lift force decreases with the decrease of the Deborah number (De). For small De, the effect of the layer elasticity is taken over by the surface tension and the lift force can become negative. We also show that the tangential stress and the interface slip velocity (the surface velocity relative to the substrate), which have been ignored in the previous analysis, give important contributions to the lift force. Especially for thin elastic layer, they give dominant contributions to the lift force.",

        "title": "Evaluation of the Antihyperglycemic efficacy of the roots of Ferula orientalis L.: An in vitro to in vivo assessment.",
        "content": "Decoctions of Ferula orientalis L. (Apiaceae), have been traditionally used to lower blood glucose levels (BGLs). After in vitro enzyme inhibition tests on the dichloromethane extracts of the roots (FOD) and the methanol extract of the roots (FOM), isolation studies were carried out on the FOD extract. The anti-hyperglycemic effects of the FOD extract and the pure compounds were studied in mice using the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) models. Molecular docking studies were performed on potent compounds in the binding pockets of enzymes α-glucosidase and α-amylase. The isolations of 11 compounds were isolated from the FOD extract, which comprised teferidine (1), ferutinin (FT) (2), teferin (3), epoxy-jaeschkeanadiol-p-hydroxybenzoate (4), epoxy-jaeschkeanadiol-6-vanillate (5), tovarol-8-angelate (6), leucoferin (7), tovarol-8-p-hydroxybenzoate (8), tovarol-8-vanillate (9), 6-β-p-hydroxybenzoyloxy-germacra-1(10),4-diene (10), and chimgin (11). Compounds 2 and 8-11 exhibited a higher inhibitory activity on α-glucosidase. In the OGTT, pretreatment with the FOD extract or compound 2 did not alter the BGLs after administration of the glucose solution compared to the control. In the STZ-induced diabetic mice model, no significant difference in the BGLs was observed with the FOD extract (200 mg/kg) or compound 2 (100 mg/kg)-treated diabetic mice compared to the diabetic control mice. The experimental studies all showed that the F. orientalis extract had significant effects on the enzyme systems involved in DM, and it would be appropriate to plan further studies on possible problems of bioavailability of the compound FT and the FOD extract, inadequate dose, and duration of administration.",

        "publishedDate": "2021-05-05T15:49:03",
        "content": "A series of recyclable epoxy resin (REP) composites are successfully prepared in this study, aiming to improve flame retardancy while keep good recyclability and mechanical properties. The commercial 9,10-Dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene 10-Oxide (DOPO) with high reactive P-H bond is used as highly-efficient flame retardant in this work. Compared with pure epoxy resin with a limited oxygen index of 21.7 % and no rating in vertical burning test, recyclable epoxy resin only with 3 wt% DOPO acquires a limited oxygen index value of 27.8% and V-0 rating. In addition, REP composites containing 4 wt% DOPO displays quick self-extinguishing behavior, which shows the 43.5% drop of the peak heat release rate. The main reason might be that traditional phosphorous-containing flame retardant existing in REP composites can play a positive role in both condensed phase and gas phase when burning. On the other hand, both scanning electron microscopy and Raman results also further affirm the improved flame retardancy. Moreover, flame-retardant REP composites can also maintain good transparency and mechanical properties. As well as the favorable recyclability originated from the special exchangeable disulfide crosslinks. High-Performance REP composites possessing expected flame retardancy, recyclability and good mechanical properties pave the way to broaden applications of thermoset epoxy materials.",

        "content": "To evaluate the fracture load of bilayer ceramic crowns manufactured by Rapid Layer Technology (RLT) after different cementation protocols of the veneering ceramic to the zirconia infrastructures. Sixty epoxy resin preparations simulating a molar tooth were obtained and 60 zirconia infrastructures and feldspathic crowns were manufactured by RLT and divided into 6 groups according to the cementation protocol at the interface to veneering ceramic (n=10): Ctr- control: conventional resin cement; Al- Al2O3 sandblasting 50µm + conventional resin cement; Al/MDP- Al2O3 sandblasting (50µm) + resin cement with MDP; Sil- silicatization 30µm + conventional resin cement; Gl/HF- glaze + hydrofluoridric acid (5%,60s) + silane + conventional resin cement; Gl- glazing as bonding agent. The feldspathic ceramic internal surface was etched with fluoridric acid (5%) + silane followed by cementation according to respective protocols. All samples were mechanically cycled (200N and 4.5x105 Pa, 37°C, 2x106 cycles, 3.4Hz) and submitted to axial compressing fracture load test (10kN, 0.5mm/min). The results(N) were submitted to descriptive and analytical statistical analysis with 1-way ANOVA, Weibull, and the Tukey test (α=0.05). ANOVA revealed that there was a significant difference among the tested groups (p<0.0001). The group Al/MDP presented the higher resistance to fracture (1972.46A N), followed by the Ctr group (1584.41B N). The characteristic strength(σ0) was significantly different (p=0.000). The crack and chipping were the predominant failures. The air-abrasion at the external surface of zirconia with Al2O3 followed by cementation with MDP resin cement, should be selected to Rapid Layer Technique when felspathic ceramic is used as veneer ceramic.",

        "content": "This paper reports the real time monitoring of siderite deposition, on both Au- and Fe-coated surfaces, using the changes in frequency and dissipation of quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCMD). In an iron chloride solution saturated with carbon dioxide, buffered with sodium bicarbonate to pH 6.8, roughly spherical particles of siderite formed within 15 min, which subsequently deposited on the QCMD crystal surface. Imaging of the surface showed a layer formed from particles ca. < 0.5 μm in diameter. Larger particles are clearly deposited on top of the lower layer; these larger particles are >1 μm in diameter. Monitoring of the frequency clearly differentiates the formation of the lower layer from the larger crystals deposited on top at later times. The elastic moduli calculated from QCMD data showed a progressive dissipation increase; the modeling of the solid-liquid interface using a flat approximation resulted in a poor estimation of elastic and storage moduli. Rather, the impedance modeled as a viscoelastic layer in contact with a semi-infinite liquid, where a random bumpy surface with a Gaussian correlator is used, is much more accurate in determining the elastic and storage moduli as losses from the uneven interface are considered. A further step considers that the film is in fact a composite consisting of hard spherical particles of siderite with water in the vacant spaces. This is treated by considering the individual contributions of the phases to the losses measured, thereby further improving the accuracy of the description of the film and the QCMD data. Collectively, this work presents a new framework for the use of QCMD, paired with traditional approaches, to enhance the understanding of crystal deposition and film formation as well as quantify the often evolving mechanical properties.",

        "publishedDate": "2017-05-12T09:17:02",
        "content": "We present an analytical study of oscillatory laminar shear flow over a compliant viscoelastic layer on a rigid base. This problem relates to oscillating blood flow in viscoelastic vessels. The deeper motivation for this study, however, is the possible use of compliant coatings for turbulent drag reduction. An analytical solution of the fluid and solid velocity is presented, and five dimensionless parameters emerge. The interaction between fluid and solid appears to be determined by a single combined dimensionless parameter, which we call the shear interaction parameter $\\chi$. The fluid satisfies a no-slip boundary condition when $\\left|\\chi\\right| \\rightarrow 0$, which occurs when the solid is heavy, stiff and/or thin. In contrast, the fluid obeys a free-slip boundary condition when $\\left|\\chi\\right| \\rightarrow \\infty$, which corresponds to a lightweight and/or soft solid. Three types of resonance modes are identified for an elastic solid. Two modes (odd and even) are specific to the solid. The third mode results from the coupling with the fluid. The three modes are less pronounced or even absent for a viscoelastic solid. These findings have a twofold use. First, they help to understand the fluid and solid dynamics when shear coupling is important. Second, the presented analytical solution is very useful for validation of numerical fluid-structure-interaction solvers. Future work might include the extension of the theory to multiple viscoelastic layers and the dynamic coupling of normal stresses.",

The WMFO aims to prevent local trapping of moths, fostering improved global search capabilities. Demonstrating a remarkable efficiency of 66.6 %, WMFO outperforms the MFO on CEC15 benchmark test functions. The Friedman and Wilcoxon tests further confirm WMFO's superiority over state-of-the-art algorithms. Introducing a hybrid model, WMFO-MLP, combining WMFO with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), facilitates effective parameter tuning for carbon emission prediction, achieving an outstanding total accuracy of 97.8 %. Comparative analysis indicates that the MLP-WMFO model surpasses alternative techniques in precision, reliability, and efficiency. Feature importance analysis reveals that variables such as Oil Efficiency and Economic Growth significantly impact MLP-WMFO's predictive power, contributing up to 40 %. Additionally, Gas Efficiency, Renewable Energy, Financial Risk, and Political Risk explain 26.5 %, 13.6 %, 8 %, and 6.5 %, respectively. Finally, WMFO-MLP performance offers advancements in optimization and predictive modeling with practical applications in carbon emission prediction.",

        "content": "We consider a cylinder immersed in viscous fluid moving near a flat substrate covered by an incompressible viscoelastic fluid layer, and study the effect of the fluid viscoelasticity on the lift force exerted on the cylinder. The lift force is zero when the viscoelastic layer is not deformed, but becomes non-zero when it is deformed. We calculate the lift force by considering both the tangential stress and the normal stress applied at the surface of the viscoelastic layer. Our analysis indicates that as the layer changes from the elastic limit to the viscous limit, the lift force decreases with the decrease of the Deborah number (De). For small De, the effect of the layer elasticity is taken over by the surface tension and the lift force can become negative. We also show that the tangential stress and the interface slip velocity (the surface velocity relative to the substrate), which have been ignored in the previous analysis, give important contributions to the lift force. Especially for thin elastic layer, they give dominant contributions to the lift force.",

We obtain convergence results by means of a nonlinear version of Trotter's theory of approximation of semigroups acting on variable Hilbert spaces. Differently from the limit models derived in [LLOO], in the present analysis the dynamic effects on the surface to which the layer shrinks do not disappear. Thus, the limiting behavior of the remaining bodies is described not only in terms of their displacements on the contact surface, but also by an additional variable that keeps track of the dynamics in the adhesive layer.",

        "content": "We consider a cylinder immersed in viscous fluid moving near a flat substrate covered by an incompressible viscoelastic fluid layer, and study the effect of the fluid viscoelasticity on the lift force exerted on the cylinder. The lift force is zero when the viscoelastic layer is not deformed, but becomes non-zero when it is deformed. We calculate the lift force by considering both the tangential stress and the normal stress applied at the surface of the viscoelastic layer. Our analysis indicates that as the layer changes from the elastic limit to the viscous limit, the lift force decreases with the decrease of the Deborah number (De). For small De, the effect of the layer elasticity is taken over by the surface tension and the lift force can become negative. We also show that the tangential stress and the interface slip velocity (the surface velocity relative to the substrate), which have been ignored in the previous analysis, give important contributions to the lift force. Especially for thin elastic layers, they give dominant contributions to the lift force.",

        "content": "The problem of the detachment of a sufficiently large flat indenter from a plane adhesive viscoelastic strip of thickness \"b\" is studied. For any given retraction speed, three different detachment regimes are found: (i) for very small \"b\" the detachment stress is constant and equal to the theoretical strength of the interface, (ii) for intermediate values of \"b\" the detachment stress decays approximately as b^(-1/2), (iii) for thick layers a constant detachment stress is obtained corresponding to case the punch is detaching from a halfplane. By using the boundary element method a comprehensive numerical study is performed which assumes a linear viscoelastic material with a single relaxation time and a Lennard-Jones force-separation law. Pull-off stress is found to consistently and monotonically increase with unloading rate, but to be almost insensitive to the history of the contact. Due to viscoelasticity, unloading at high enough retraction velocity may allow punches of macroscopic size to reach the theoretical strength of the interface. Finally, a corrective term in Greenwood or Persson theories considering finite size effects is proposed. Theoretical and numerical results are found in very good agreement.",

        "content": "An enhanced lightness and thinness is the inevitable trend of modern industrial production, which will also lead to prominent low-frequency vibration problems in the associated structure. To solve the vibration problem of thin plate structures in various engineering fields, the active constrained layer damping (ACLD) thin plate structure is taken as the research object to study vibration control. Based on the FEM method, energy method, and Hamilton principle, the dynamic model of an ACLD thin plate structure is derived, in which the Golla-Hughes-McTavish (GHM) model is used to characterize the damping characteristics of the viscoelastic layer, and the equivalent Rayleigh damping is used to characterize the damping characteristics of the base layer. The order of the model is reduced based on the high-precision physical condensation method and balance reduction method, and the model has good controllability and observability. An LQR controller is designed to actively control the ACLD sheet, and the controller parameters and piezoelectric sheet parameters are optimized. The results show that the finite element model established in this paper is accurate under different boundary conditions, and the model can still accurately and reliably describe the dynamic characteristics of the original system in the time and frequency domain after using the joint reduction method. Under different excitation and boundary conditions, LQR control can effectively suppress structural vibration. Considering the performance and cost balance, the most suitable control parameter for the system is: Q-matrix coefficient is between 1 × 10",

        "content": "Direct numerical simulations of turbulent flow in a channel with one rigid and one viscoelastic wall are performed. An Eulerian-Eulerian model is adopted with a level-set approach to identify the fluid-compliant material interface. Focus is placed on the propagation of Rayleigh waves in the compliant material, whose speed depends on the shear modulus of elasticity and whose dominant wavelength depends on the thickness of the viscoelastic layer. These parameters are selected to ensure coupling between the compliant surface and turbulence. When the phase speed of Rayleigh waves is commensurate with the advection velocity of near-wall pressure fluctuations, sheets of vorticity are lifted up and detached near the critical layer and lead to a local pressure minimum. These events are caused by the inflectional velocity profile near the troughs, and are controlled by the net vorticity flux at the elastic surface. This phenomenon is central to understanding the statistical characteristics of the flow, including the surface deformation-pressure correlation and enhanced stochastic turbulent shear stresses. The pressure work onto the fluid is positive at the surface, which increases the turbulent intensity and wall-normal mixing, without any streamwise momentum gain. Finally, we discuss the influence of three-dimensionality of the surface topography on the generation of streamwise vorticity, secondary motions, and lateral turbulent transport.",

        "content": "A finite element dynamic model of the sandwich composite plate was developed based on classical laminate theory and Hamilton's principle. A 4-node, 7-degree-of-freedom three-layer plate cell is constructed to simulate the interaction between the substrate, the viscoelastic damping layer, and the piezoelectric material layer. Among them, the viscoelastic layer is referred to as the complex constant shear modulus model, and the equivalent Rayleigh damping is introduced to represent the damping of the substrate. The established dynamics model has too many degrees of freedom, and the obtained dynamics model has good controllability and observability after adopting the joint reduced-order method of dynamic condensation in physical space and equilibrium in state space. The optimal quadratic (LQR) controller is designed for the active control of the sandwich panel, and the parameters of the controller parameters, the thickness of the viscoelastic layer, and the optimal covering position of the sandwich panel are optimized through simulation analysis. The results show that the finite element model established in this paper is still valid under different boundary conditions and different covering methods, and the model can still accurately and reliably represent the dynamic characteristics of the original system after using the joint step-down method. Under different excitation signals and different boundary conditions, the LQR control can effectively suppress the vibration of the sandwich plate. The optimal cover position of the sandwich plate is near the solid support end and far from the free-degree end. The parameters of controller parameters and viscoelastic layer thickness are optimized from several angles, respectively, and a reasonable optimization scheme can be selected according to the actual requirements.",

        "content": "A computational approach that is based on interface finite elements with eMbedded Profiles for Joint Roughness (MPJR) is exploited in order to study the viscoelastic contact problems with any complex shape of the indenting profiles. The MPJR finite elements, previously developed for partial slip contact problems, are herein further generalized in order to deal with finite sliding displacements. The approach is applied to a case study concerning a periodic contact problem between a sinusoidal profile and a viscoelastic layer of finite thickness. In particular, the effect of using three different rheological models that are based on Prony series (with one, two, or three arms) to approximate the viscoelastic behaviour of a real polymer is investigated. The method allows for predicting the whole transient regime during the normal contact problem and the subsequent sliding scenario from full stick to full slip, and then up to gross sliding. The effects of the viscoelastic model approximation and of the sliding velocities are carefully investigated. The proposed approach aims at tackling a class of problems that are difficult to address with other methods, which include the possibility of analysing indenters of generic profile, the capability of simulating partial slip and gross slip due to finite slidings, and, finally, the possibility of simultaneously investigating dissipative phenomena, like viscoelastic dissipation and energy losses due to interface friction.",

Here we experimentally study the break-up of a liquid filament of a silica nanoparticle dispersion in a background oil phase that contains surfactant assemblies. Although self-similar power-law pinch-off is well documented for threads of Newtonian fluids, we report that when a viscoelastic layer is formed in situ at the interface, the pinch-off dynamics follows an exponential decay. Recently, such exponential neck thinning was found theoretically when surface viscous effects were taken into account. We introduce a simple approach to calculate the effective relaxation time of viscoelastic interfaces and estimate the thickness of the interfacial layer and the viscoelastic properties of liquid-fluid interfaces, where the direct measurement of interfacial rheology is not possible.",

        "content": "Averting the effects of anthropogenic climate change requires a transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon technology. A way to achieve this is to decarbonize the electricity grid. However, further efforts must be made in other fields such as transport and heating for full decarbonization. This would reduce carbon emissions due to electricity generation, and also help to decarbonize other sources such as automotive and heating by enabling a low-carbon alternative. Carbon taxes have been shown to be an efficient way to aid in this transition. In this paper, we demonstrate how to to find optimal carbon tax policies through a genetic algorithm approach, using the electricity market agent-based model ElecSim. To achieve this, we use the NSGA-II genetic algorithm to minimize average electricity price and relative carbon intensity of the electricity mix. We demonstrate that it is possible to find a range of carbon taxes to suit differing objectives. Our results show that we are able to minimize electricity cost to below \\textsterling10/MWh as well as carbon intensity to zero in every case. In terms of the optimal carbon tax strategy, we found that an increasing strategy between 2020 and 2035 was preferable. Each of the Pareto-front optimal tax strategies are at least above \\textsterling81/tCO2 for every year. The mean carbon tax strategy was \\textsterling240/tCO2.",

Based on the finite element method and Golla-Hughes-McTavish (GHM) model, the system dynamics equation is established. Models are simplified in physical and modal space because of unobservable and uncontrollable. Based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) feedback gain was optimized. The effect of system vibration damping under different controller parameters, piezoelectric-constrained layer position and excitation signal was studied. The study show that the optimal feedback gain of the controller can effectively balance the control effect and the control cost. The closer the piezoelectric layer and viscoelastic layer are to the fixed end, the better the system control effect and the smaller the control cost.

        "title": "Optimal pricing for carbon dioxide removal under inter-regional leakage",
        "publishedDate": "2022-12-19T08:33:43",
        "content": "Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) moves atmospheric carbon to geological or land-based sinks. In a first-best setting, the optimal use of CDR is achieved by a removal subsidy that equals the optimal carbon tax and marginal damages. We derive second-best policy rules for CDR subsidies and carbon taxes when no global carbon price exists but a national government implements a unilateral climate policy. We find that the optimal carbon tax differs from an optimal CDR subsidy because of carbon leakage and a balance of resource trade effect. First, the optimal removal subsidy tends to be larger than the carbon tax because of lower supply-side leakage on fossil resource markets. Second, net carbon exporters exacerbate this wedge to increase producer surplus of their carbon resource producers, implying even larger removal subsidies. Third, net carbon importers may set their removal subsidy even below their carbon tax when marginal environmental damages are small, to appropriate producer surplus from carbon exporters.",

        "title": "Interfacial behavior of vegetable protein isolates at sunflower oil/water interface.",
        "content": "Proteins are widely used in the formation and stabilization of multiphase systems, thanks to their ability to adsorb at the interface reducing the interfacial tension and promoting the formation of viscoelastic layers. Owing to the growing consumer demand, the food industry is moving toward the growing use of plant-based proteins, suitable for consumers who do not eat products of animal origin, for either ethical or health reasons. Nevertheless, the scientific literature lacks information on the surface activity and emulsifying ability of these proteins. In this work, the interfacial properties of soy, hemp and brown rice isolate proteins were investigated at the interface with commercial sunflower oil (O/W) to evaluate their characteristics in view of potential uses in food applications such as emulsions, sauces, dressing, topping and soft foods. Dilatational and shear kinematic, with pendant drop and magnetic rod techniques, respectively, were used. The dilatational analysis was performed in static and dynamic conditions, to obtain the equilibrium adsorption isotherms and the rheological parameters of the interfacial layers under both oscillation and stress relaxation. The interfaces were studied in shear conditions with small amplitude oscillations and creep tests. The obtained results evidenced that all tested proteins are able to build a strong viscoelastic layer with properties comparable to those of animal proteins. Brown rice protein seems particularly effective in reducing the interfacial tension even if shear tests evidence that the interface is weaker than that obtained using hemp or soy protein. Hemp protein seems very promising for potential practical uses yielding intermediate interfacial tensions and strong viscoelastic layers.",

        "content": "In this paper, we compare different mitigation policies when housing investments are irreversible. We use a general equilibrium model with non-homothetic preferences and an elaborate setup of the residential housing and energy production sector. In the first-best transition, the energy demand plays only a secondary role. However, this changes when optimal carbon taxes are not available. While providing subsidies for retrofits results in the lowest direct costs for households, it ultimately leads to the highest aggregate costs and proves to be an ineffective way to decarbonize the economy. In the second-best context, a phased-in carbon price outperforms the subsidy-based transition.",

        "content": "We investigate optimal carbon abatement in a dynamic general equilibrium climate-economy model with endogenous structural change. By differentiating the production of investment from consumption, we show that social cost of carbon can be conceived as a reduction in physical capital. In addition, we distinguish two final sectors in terms of productivity growth and climate vulnerability. We theoretically show that heterogeneous climate vulnerability results in a climate-induced version of Baumol's cost disease. Further, if climate-vulnerable sectors have high (low) productivity growth, climate impact can either ameliorate (aggravate) the Baumol's cost disease, call for less (more) stringent climate policy. We conclude that carbon abatement should not only factor in unpriced climate capital, but also be tailored to Baumol's cost and climate diseases.",

When switching to a newer device with upgraded functions, therapy completely failed. A video recording performed by the patient's wife showed high frequency mask movements suggesting inability to maintain a therapeutic pressure with high frequency pressure fluctuations, confirmed afterwards during full night polysomnography and in a bench study. CPAP manufacturers may put on the market new devices with supposedly better algorithms that in fact may have escaped serious pre-marketing evaluation and that may jeopardize the efficacy of a well proven treatment.

        "content": "Radiofrequency reflectometry can provide fast and sensitive electrical read-out of charge and spin qubits in quantum dot devices coupled to resonant circuits. In situ frequency tuning and impedance matching of the resonator circuit using voltage-tunable capacitors (varactors) is needed to optimize read-out sensitivity, but the performance of conventional semiconductor- and ferroelectric-based varactors degrades substantially in the millikelvin temperature range relevant for solid-state quantum devices. Here we show that strontium titanate and potassium tantalate, materials which can exhibit quantum paraelectric behaviour with large field-tunable permittivity at low temperatures, can be used to make varactors with perfect impedance matching and resonator frequency tuning at 6 mK. We characterize the varactors at 6 mK in terms of their capacitance tunability, dissipative losses and magnetic field insensitivity. We use the quantum paraelectric varactors to optimize the radiofrequency read-out of carbon nanotube quantum dot devices, achieving a charge sensitivity of 4.8 μ",

        "content": "We present an analytical study of oscillatory laminar shear flow over a compliant viscoelastic layer on a rigid base. This problem relates to oscillating blood flow in viscoelastic vessels. The deeper motivation for this study, however, is the possible use of compliant coatings for turbulent drag reduction. An analytical solution of the fluid and solid velocity is presented, and five dimensionless parameters emerge. The interaction between fluid and solid appears to be determined by a single combined dimensionless parameter, which we call the shear interaction parameter $\\chi$. The fluid satisfies a no-slip boundary condition when $\\left|\\chi\\right| \\rightarrow 0$, which occurs when the solid is heavy, stiff and/or thin. In contrast, the fluid obeys a free-slip boundary condition when $\\left|\\chi\\right| \\rightarrow \\infty$, which corresponds to a lightweight and/or soft solid. Three types of resonance modes are identified for an elastic solid. Two modes (odd and even) are specific to the solid. The third mode results from the coupling with the fluid. The three modes are less pronounced or even absent for a viscoelastic solid. These findings have a twofold use. First, they help to understand the fluid and solid dynamics when shear coupling is important. Second, the presented analytical solution is very useful for validation of numerical fluid-structure-interaction solvers. Future work might include the extension of the theory to multiple viscoelastic layers and the dynamic coupling of normal stresses.",

        "content": "In this work, echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) with flyback readout gradient-echo train was implemented in a preclinical MR scanner. The aim of this study is to visualize and quantify the ghost spectral lines produced by two, three and four interleaved echo trains with different amplitudes of the readout gradients, and to investigate the feasibility of the flyback data acquisition in micro-imaging of small animals. Applied multi-slice EPSI sequence utilizes asymmetric gradient-echo train that combines the shortest possible rewind gradients with readout gradients. It simplifies data processing because all echoes are acquired with the same polarity of the readout gradient. The approach with four interleaved gradient-echo trains and with four echoes in each train provides broad spectral bandwidth in combination with narrow receiver bandwidth and a good water-fat signal separation. It improves signal-to-noise ratio without the undesired consequence of water-fat shift artifacts that are eliminated during data processing. Position, number, and intensity of the ghost spectral lines can be controlled by the suitable choice of spectral bandwidth, number of echo train interleaves, and the number of echoes in each interleave. This study demonstrates that high-spatial resolution EPSI with interleaved flyback readout gradient-echo trains is feasible on standard preclinical scanners.",

In particular, we provide a representation-theoretic framework for interleavings, showing that the category of interleavings under a fixed translation is isomorphic to the representation category of what we call a shoelace. Using our framework, we show that any two interleavings of the same pair of persistence modules are themselves interleaved. Furthermore, in the special case of persistence modules over $\\mathbb{Z}$, we show that matchings between barcodes correspond to the interval-decomposable interleavings.",

        "content": "We consider a cylinder immersed in viscous fluid moving near a flat substrate covered by an incompressible viscoelastic fluid layer, and study the effect of the fluid viscoelasticity on the lift force exerted on the cylinder. The lift force is zero when the viscoelastic layer is not deformed, but becomes non-zero when it is deformed. We calculate the lift force by considering both the tangential stress and the normal stress applied at the surface of the viscoelastic layer. Our analysis indicates that as the layer changes from the elastic limit to the viscous limit, the lift force decreases with the decrease of the Deborah number (De). For small De, the effect of the layer elasticity is taken over by the surface tension and the lift force can become negative. We also show that the tangential stress and the interface slip velocity (the surface velocity relative to the substrate), which have been ignored in the previous analysis, give important contributions to the lift force. Especially for thin elastic layer, they give dominant contributions to the lift force.",

        "content": "Using acoustic vortex tweezers (AVT) to spatially accumulate microbubbles (MBs) shows promise for enhancing drug delivery efficiency and reducing off-target effects. The strong echogenicity of accumulated MBs also improves diagnostics via conventional ultrasound (US) B-mode imaging. However, the annular high-pressure distribution of AVT inhibits MBs inflow at the inlet, reducing MBs collection. The spatial resolution of US B-mode imaging further limits theranostic applications of AVT-mediated MBs accumulation. To address these challenges, we integrated an AVT waveform with volumetric super-resolution imaging (VSRI) to monitor the dynamic growth of MBs cluster during accumulation. We used a 5-MHz 2D array transducer for VSRI, employing plane wave pulses interleaved with accumulating pulses to retain MBs at a flow rate of 0.023-0.047 mL/s in a 3-mm vessel phantom. An asymmetrical AVT waveform (AVT*) was produced by modulating the pressure at the MBs inlet compared to the outlet. The effectiveness was validated in rat cerebral vessels for real-time volumetric tracking of MBs clusters. Microscopy observations showed that AVT* could quickly gather flowing MBs into cluster without repelling them at a flow rate of 0.023 mL/s. Statistical results indicated that microscopic data correlated better with VSRI than with B-mode images, suggesting VSRI suffices to detect the dynamics of AVT*-actuated MBs accumulation in real-time. Additionally, VSRI detected a significant increase in MBs cluster size over time during AVT* in the superior sagittal sinus of the rat brain. These findings demonstrate that the proposed strategy can accumulate the flowing MBs at a desired location and simultaneously observe this phenomenon.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-06-01T22:55:35",
        "content": "Merge trees, contour trees, and Reeb graphs are graph-based topological descriptors that capture topological changes of (sub)level sets of scalar fields. Comparing scalar fields using their topological descriptors has many applications in topological data analysis and visualization of scientific data. Recently, Munch and Stefanou introduced a labeled interleaving distance for comparing two labeled merge trees, which enjoys a number of theoretical and algorithmic properties. In particular, the labeled interleaving distance between merge trees can be computed in polynomial time. In this work, we define the labeled interleaving distance for labeled Reeb graphs. We then prove that the (ordinary) interleaving distance between Reeb graphs equals the minimum of the labeled interleaving distance over all labelings. We also provide an efficient algorithm for computing the labeled interleaving distance between two labeled contour trees (which are special types of Reeb graphs that arise from simply-connected domains). In the case of merge trees, the notion of the labeled interleaving distance was used by Gasparovic et al. to prove that the (ordinary) interleaving distance on the set of (unlabeled) merge trees is intrinsic. As our final contribution, we present counterexamples showing that, on the contrary, the (ordinary) interleaving distance on (unlabeled) Reeb graphs (and contour trees) is not intrinsic. It turns out that, under mild conditions on the labelings, the labeled interleaving distance is a metric on isomorphism classes of Reeb graphs, analogous to the ordinary interleaving distance. This provides new metrics on large classes of Reeb graphs.",

        "title": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Evaluation and Classification of Vascular Malformations.",
        "content": "Introduction Vascular malformations of the soft tissues are a diverse collection of lesions frequently encountered in clinical practice. Vascular malformations are rare and complex abnormalities that affect both children and young adults. Low-flow malformations are more common in children and often become symptomatic in later years. These malformations are common causes of soft tissue masses in children and can affect any part of the body at any age. Significant advancements in the management of these conditions have been made due to the implementation of a comprehensive binary categorization system, which classifies vascular abnormalities into tumors and malformations based on their clinicopathological characteristics. Imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plays a crucial role in the accurate identification, localization, and classification of these lesions, aiding in the development of appropriate treatment plans. Materials and methods This prospective study was conducted at Dr. D. Y. Patil Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, Pimpri, Pune, from August 2022 to June 2024. Fifty patients of all age groups with clinically suspected soft tissue vascular malformations were included. MRI was performed using a MAGNETOM Vida (3T) Scanner (Siemens Healthcare Private Limited, Mumbai, India), and ultrasound was used as an adjunct. Institutional Ethics Committee clearance and informed consent were obtained. The study employed various MRI sequences, including T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) fast spin echo (FSE), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) FSE, short tau inversion recovery (STIR), T2-weighted gradient recalled echo (GRE), pre-contrast fat-saturated T1WI, 3D post-contrast T1WI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and ANGIO TWIST (time-resolved angiography with interleaved stochastic trajectories) ISO. Results The study included 50 patients, with a male predominance of 28 (56%). The mean age was 22.13 years, and the average duration of vascular malformations was 32.94 months. The swelling was present in 43 (86%) of patients, and 35 (70%) had superficial lesions. MRI findings revealed hypointensity on T1 imaging in 40 (80%) patients and hyperintensity on T2 imaging in 49 (98%) cases. STIR sequences showed hyperintensity in all patients. The most common type of vascular malformation was slow-flow 46 (92%), with venous malformations being the most prevalent 39 (78%). Conclusion MRI is a valuable imaging modality for the evaluation and classification of vascular malformations, providing detailed information on lesion extent and involvement of surrounding tissues. The findings support the use of MRI as a primary tool in the assessment of vascular malformations, with ultrasound serving as a useful adjunct in certain cases. Further studies with larger sample sizes are recommended to validate these findings and refine imaging protocols.",

        "title": "An Interleaving Distance for Ordered Merge Trees",
        "publishedDate": "2023-12-18T11:21:58",
        "content": "Merge trees are a common topological descriptor for data with a hierarchical component, such as terrains and scalar fields. The interleaving distance, in turn, is a common distance measure for comparing merge trees. However, the interleaving distance for merge trees is solely based on the hierarchical structure, and disregards any other geometrical or topological properties that might be present in the underlying data. Furthermore, the interleaving distance is NP-hard to compute. In this paper, we introduce a form of ordered merge trees that does capture intrinsic order present in the data. We further define a natural variant of the interleaving distance, the monotone interleaving distance, which is an order preserving distance measure for ordered merge trees. Analogous to the regular interleaving distance for merge trees, we show that the monotone variant has three equivalent definitions in terms of two maps, a single map, or a labelling. The labelling-based definition fairly directly leads to an efficient algorithm for computing the monotone interleaving distance, but unfortunately it computes only an approximation thereof. Instead, we discover a surprising connection between the monotone interleaving distance of ordered merge trees and the Fr\\'{e}chet distance of 1D curves. As a result, the monotone interleaving distance between two ordered merge trees of total complexity $n$ can be computed exactly in $\\tilde O(n^2)$ time. The connection between the monotone interleaving distance and the Fr\\'{e}chet distance establishes a new bridge between the fields of computational topology/topological data analysis, where interleaving distances are studied extensively, and computational geometry, where Fr\\'{e}chet distances are studied extensively.",

        "title": "Neural Mechanisms of Learning and Consolidation of Morphologically Derived Words in a Novel Language: Evidence From Hebrew Speakers.",
        "content": "We examined neural mechanisms associated with the learning of novel morphologically derived words in native Hebrew speakers within the Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) framework. Across four sessions, 28 participants were trained on an artificial language, which included two types of morphologically complex words: linear (root + suffix) with a salient structure, and non-linear (root interleaved with template), with a prominent derivational structure in participants' first language (L1). A third simple monomorphemic condition, which served as baseline, was also included. On the first and fourth sessions, training was followed by testing in an fMRI scanner. Our behavioural results showed decomposition of both types of complex words, with the linear structure more easily learned than the non-linear structure. Our fMRI results showed involvement of frontal areas, associated with decomposition, only for the non-linear condition, after just the first session. We also observed training-related increases in activation in temporal areas specifically for the non-linear condition, which was correlated with participants' L1 morphological awareness. These results demonstrate that morphological decomposition of derived words occurs in the very early stages of word learning, is influenced by L1 experience, and can facilitate word learning. However, in contrast to the CLS framework, we found no support for a shift from reliance on hippocampus to reliance on cortical areas in any of our conditions. Instead, our findings align more closely with recent theories showing a positive correlation between changes in hippocampus and cortical areas, suggesting that these representations co-exist and continue to interact with one another beyond initial learning.",

        "title": "HER4 is a high-affinity dimerization partner for all EGFR/HER/ErbB family proteins.",
        "content": "Human epidermal growth factor receptors (HER)-also known as EGFR or ErbB receptors-are a subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that play crucial roles in cell growth, division, and differentiation. HER4 (ErbB4) is the least studied member of this family, partly because its expression is lower in later stages of development. Recent work has suggested that HER4 can play a role in metastasis by regulating cell migration and invasiveness; however, unlike EGFR and HER2, the precise role that HER4 plays in tumorigenesis is still unresolved. Early work on HER family proteins suggested that there are direct interactions between the four members, but to date, there has been no single study of all four receptors in the same cell line with the same biophysical method. Here, we quantitatively measure the degree of association between HER4 and the other HER family proteins in live cells with a time-resolved fluorescence technique called pulsed interleaved excitation fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (PIE-FCCS). PIE-FCCS is sensitive to the oligomerization state of membrane proteins in live cells, while simultaneously measuring single-cell protein expression levels and diffusion coefficients. Our PIE-FCCS results demonstrate that HER4 interacts directly with all HER family members in the cell plasma membrane. The interaction between HER4 and other HER family members intensified in the presence of a HER4-specific ligand. Our work suggests that HER4 is a preferred dimerization partner for all HER family proteins, even in the absence of ligands.",

        "publishedDate": "2020-04-29T16:05:45",
        "content": "The interleaving distance, although originally developed for persistent homology, has been generalized to measure the distance between functors modeled on many posets or even small categories. Existing theories require that such a poset have a superlinear family of translations or a similar structure. However, many posets of interest to topological data analysis, such as zig-zag posets and the face relation poset of a cell-complex, do not admit interesting translations, and consequently don't admit a nice theory of interleavings. In this paper we show how one can side-step this limitation by providing a general theory where one maps to a poset that does admit interesting translations, such as the lattice of down sets, and then defines interleavings relative to this map. Part of our theory includes a rigorous notion of discretization or \"pixelization\" of poset modules, which in turn we use for interleaving inference. We provide an approximation condition that in the setting of lattices gives rise to two possible pixelizations, both of which are guaranteed to be close in the interleaving distance. Finally, we conclude by considering interleaving inference for cosheaves over a metric space and give an explicit description of interleavings over a grid structure on Euclidean space.",

        "content": "Independent control of electromagnetic (EM) waves by metasurfaces for multiple tasks are highly desired and is the recent hot topic of research. In this work we contribute a polarization insensitive frequency multiplexed 2-bit coding metasurface to control the Terahertz (THz) waves in the two operating bands independently. In this regard, as a first step a cascaded meta-atom composed of square rings and/or square metallic patches separated by two polyimide substrates is designed and optimized that provides sixteen independent distinct discrete phases in the reflection geometry. These meta-atoms are then distributed with distinct coding sequences in the two-dimensional spatial plane to realize various bi-functional metasurfaces. As a proof of the concept various full structures are designed and simulated to realize a series of bi-functionalities including anomalous reflection/beam shaping, beam shaping/anomalous reflection, beam deflection/Orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam generation with distinct modes and propagating wave to surface wave (PW-SW) conversion/PW beam manipulation in the lower and higher THz bands, respectively. All the simulation results are in excellent agreement with their theoretical equivalents. We envision that the proposed meta-designs have potential applications for the multi-spectral control of EM waves in THz band. The idea can be further extended to design frequency dependent tri-functional and multi-functional THz meta-devices.",

        "content": "As a step towards establishing homotopy-theoretic foundations for topological data analysis (TDA), we introduce and study homotopy interleavings between filtered topological spaces. These are homotopy-invariant analogues of interleavings, objects commonly used in TDA to articulate stability and inference theorems. Intuitively, whereas a strict interleaving between filtered spaces $X$ and $Y$ certifies that $X$ and $Y$ are approximately isomorphic, a homotopy interleaving between $X$ and $Y$ certifies that $X$ and $Y$ are approximately weakly equivalent. The main results of this paper are that homotopy interleavings induce an extended pseudometric $d_{HI}$ on filtered spaces, and that this is the universal pseudometric satisfying natural stability and homotopy invariance axioms. To motivate these axioms, we also observe that $d_{HI}$ (or more generally, any pseudometric satisfying these two axioms and an additional \"homology bounding\" axiom) can be used to formulate lifts of several fundamental TDA theorems from the algebraic (homological) level to the level of filtered spaces. Finally, we consider the problem of establishing a persistent Whitehead theorem in terms of homotopy interleavings. We provide a counterexample to a naive formulation of the result.",

        "content": "We all possess a mental library of schemas that specify how different types of events unfold. How are these schemas acquired? A key challenge is that learning a new schema can catastrophically interfere with old knowledge. One solution to this dilemma is to use interleaved training to learn a single representation that accommodates all schemas. However, another class of models posits that catastrophic interference can be avoided by splitting off new representations when large prediction errors occur. A key differentiating prediction is that, according to splitting models, catastrophic interference can be prevented even under blocked training curricula. We conducted a series of semi-naturalistic experiments and simulations with Bayesian and neural network models to compare the predictions made by the \"splitting\" versus \"non-splitting\" hypotheses of schema learning. We found better performance in blocked compared to interleaved curricula, and explain these results using a Bayesian model that incorporates representational splitting in response to large prediction errors. In a follow-up experiment, we validated the model prediction that inserting blocked training early in learning leads to better learning performance than inserting blocked training later in learning. Our results suggest that different learning environments (i.e., curricula) play an important role in shaping schema composition.",

        "publishedDate": "2021-03-12T00:54:22",
        "content": "Interleaving learning is a human learning technique where a learner interleaves the studies of multiple topics, which increases long-term retention and improves ability to transfer learned knowledge. Inspired by the interleaving learning technique of humans, in this paper we explore whether this learning methodology is beneficial for improving the performance of machine learning models as well. We propose a novel machine learning framework referred to as interleaving learning (IL). In our framework, a set of models collaboratively learn a data encoder in an interleaving fashion: the encoder is trained by model 1 for a while, then passed to model 2 for further training, then model 3, and so on; after trained by all models, the encoder returns back to model 1 and is trained again, then moving to model 2, 3, etc. This process repeats for multiple rounds. Our framework is based on multi-level optimization consisting of multiple inter-connected learning stages. An efficient gradient-based algorithm is developed to solve the multi-level optimization problem. We apply interleaving learning to search neural architectures for image classification on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The effectiveness of our method is strongly demonstrated by the experimental results.",

        "content": "Nowadays, convectional metallic material replaced by composite materials, because composite materials have superior than metallic materials properties such as light weights, higher strength-to-weight ratio, high tensile strength, Low cost, greater design flexibility, better fatigue resistance, renewability, and biodegradability. These properties of composite material are the most basic & common attractive features that make them useful for industrial applications. The main objective of this work is to contribute for a better understanding of the static behavior of structure made from fiber reinforced composite materials, specifically for the case of plate structures. The plate model is created using SOLIDWORKS 2017 and then imported into ANSYS R18.1. The study specifically examines three stacking sequences of the composite plate (angle ply, cross ply, and multidirectional ply) to analysis stress and deformation resulted from the loads. The static analysis of a Carbon/Epoxy with honeycomb plate composite reveals that the equivalent stress and deformation are lower in the cross-ply stacking sequence compared to the angle ply and multidirectional ply for the same load carrying capacity. This suggests that the composite plate with a cross ply configuration is more suitable for manufacturing composite structures due to its improved performance.",

        "content": "Understanding the previous protection and restoration efforts and the current state of cultural relics is essential before compiling a conservation and restoration plan. The lack of detailed archival records for some early conservation operations, the identification of restoration materials necessitates the use of scientific analytical methods. In this study, the composition and spatial distribution of historical restoration materials on five iron relics were investigated through pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and ultraviolet-induced visible luminescence imaging (UVL). The relics studied were iron weight 20791, iron adze head 2335, and iron axe 2334 from the Gansu Provincial Museum, iron sword D0008 from the Zhaotong Municipal Museum, and iron sword 450 from the National Museum of China. All five relics had undergone restoration without accompanying archival records. UVL revealed the distribution of various conservation materials. Notably, two distinct layers of the conservation material were observed on iron axe 2334. Differences in the fluorescence color and intensity of iron sword 450 provided information regarding the sampling strategy. The samples were collected under ultraviolet light emitting diode illumination to ensure representativeness and minimize damage to the relics. Through Py-GC/MS, the coating materials for iron weight 20791 and iron adze head 2335 were identified as boiled tung oil mixed with rosin resin. Iron axis 2334 had a two-layer coating: a base layer of boiled tung oil and a top layer of shellac. The coating material for iron sword D0008 was determined to be paraffin wax. The protective layer of iron sword 450 included multiple materials, including shellac, polystyrene, and bisphenol-A-type epoxy resin. This study confirms that UVL combined with Py-GC/MS serves as an effective technique for analyzing historical restoration materials. UVL guided the selection of representative samples for Py-GC/MS, reducing the time and amount of sampling required and minimizing further damage to the relics. This research provides valuable data for the restoration archives of five iron artifacts, offering a scientific basis for conservators to evaluate conservation methods, devise future conservation strategies, and exclude ineffective conservation materials.",

        "content": "The value of biomaterials for green products has begun to develop more ecofriendly and renewable sustainable materials for a better circular economy and to reduce carbon footprints. This work presents integrated investigations of the lignocellulosic date palm/epoxy composites at various reinforcement condition parameters for sustainable structural materials where elemental mapping, topological analysis, and mechanical performance have been performed. Mapping energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was utilized to assess the composite composition properly. Elemental mapping and a scanning electron microscope were employed to evaluate the chemical composition of the composites. The mechanical performance of the produced composites was also explored in terms of ultimate tensile strength, tensile modulus, elongation at break, and impact energy properties. The effects of fiber loading, fiber length, and fiber width (as long fiber, short fiber, and long-thin fiber) were investigated for the date palm fiber/epoxy composites. Results have revealed that the composite behavior was affected by several influential reinforcement parameters. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy maps by C-K, O-K, Si-K, K-K, and Ca-K demonstrated that the composites contain mainly carbon, silicon, and oxygen. It was evident that the modulus of elasticity property of short fiber composites exhibits an increasing trend with higher fiber content, even at 35 wt%. Moreover, the enhancement of tensile strength for the short fiber size composites reached 72.5 %. However, such tensile strength of thin fiber size/epoxy composites achieved 135.7 % at 25 wt% indicating superior development of this mechanical property. The long date palm fiber composites demonstrated the best value of modulus of elasticity and the maximum impact energy of 15.3 kJ/m",

        "content": "Decoctions of Ferula orientalis L. (Apiaceae), have been traditionally used to lower blood glucose levels (BGLs). After in vitro enzyme inhibition tests on the dichloromethane extracts of the roots (FOD) and the methanol extract of the roots (FOM), isolation studies were carried out on the FOD extract. The anti-hyperglycemic effects of the FOD extract and the pure compounds were studied in mice using the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) models. Molecular docking studies were performed on potent compounds in the binding pockets of enzymes α-glucosidase and α-amylase. The isolations of 11 compounds were isolated from the FOD extract, which comprised teferidine (1), ferutinin (FT) (2), teferin (3), epoxy-jaeschkeanadiol-p-hydroxybenzoate (4), epoxy-jaeschkeanadiol-6-vanillate (5), tovarol-8-angelate (6), leucoferin (7), tovarol-8-p-hydroxybenzoate (8), tovarol-8-vanillate (9), 6-β-p-hydroxybenzoyloxy-germacra-1(10),4-diene (10), and chimgin (11). Compounds 2 and 8-11 exhibited a higher inhibitory activity on α-glucosidase. In the OGTT, pretreatment with the FOD extract or compound 2 did not alter the BGLs after administration of the glucose solution compared to the control. In the STZ-induced diabetic mice model, no significant difference in the BGLs was observed with the FOD extract (200 mg/kg) or compound 2 (100 mg/kg)-treated diabetic mice compared to the diabetic control mice. The experimental studies all showed that the F. orientalis extract had significant effects on the enzyme systems involved in DM, and it would be appropriate to plan further studies on possible problems of bioavailability of the compound FT and the FOD extract, inadequate dose, and duration of administration.",

        "content": "To evaluate the fracture load of bilayer ceramic crowns manufactured by Rapid Layer Technology (RLT) after different cementation protocols of the veneering ceramic to the zirconia infrastructures. Sixty epoxy resin preparations simulating a molar tooth were obtained and 60 zirconia infrastructures and feldspathic crowns were manufactured by RLT and divided into 6 groups according to the cementation protocol at the interface to veneering ceramic (n=10): Ctr- control: conventional resin cement; Al- Al2O3 sandblasting 50µm + conventional resin cement; Al/MDP- Al2O3 sandblasting (50µm) + resin cement with MDP; Sil- silicatization 30µm + conventional resin cement; Gl/HF- glaze + hydrofluoridric acid (5%,60s) + silane + conventional resin cement; Gl- glazing as bonding agent. The feldspathic ceramic internal surface was etched with fluoridric acid (5%) + silane followed by cementation according to respective protocols. All samples were mechanically cycled (200N and 4.5x105 Pa, 37°C, 2x106 cycles, 3.4Hz) and submitted to axial compressing fracture load test (10kN, 0.5mm/min). The results(N) were submitted to descriptive and analytical statistical analysis with 1-way ANOVA, Weibull, and the Tukey test (α=0.05). ANOVA revealed that there was a significant difference among the tested groups (p<0.0001). The group Al/MDP presented the higher resistance to fracture (1972.46A N), followed by the Ctr group (1584.41B N). The characteristic strength(σ0) was significantly different (p=0.000). The crack and chipping were the predominant failures. The air-abrasion at the external surface of zirconia with Al2O3 followed by cementation with MDP resin cement, should be selected to Rapid Layer Technique when felspathic ceramic is used as veneer ceramic.",

The porous carbon material was made from the byproduct of cellulose production and was used as additive on the development of radar absorbing material (RAM) composites. These porous carbon materials have different characteristics, such as porosity size (180 µm < Ø1 < 250 µm and 425 µm < Ø2 < 500 µm) and particle size (ϕ1 < 250 µm and 250 µm < ϕ2 < 425 µm). Composite materials were also studied as frequency selective surface (FSS) structures. It was shown how complex permittivity and reflection loss (RL) can be manipulated over the frequency range using FSS structure. While regular RAM presented RL of 19 dB at ~11.8 GHz, FSS structure presented a RL of 19 dB shifted to 12.4 GHz regarding the same carbon porous material (with particles between 250 and 425 µm and porosity between 180 and 250 µm). It was demonstrated here the potential use of sustainable porous carbon as RAM, and how FSS structure can be used to tune the frequency of the RL maximum peak.",

        "content": "Abstract Different temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry ( TMDSC ) approaches were explored for studying the frequency dependence of the vitrification phenomenon during the cure of a thermosetting epoxy resin. All approaches show the expected decrease in vitrification time with increasing frequency. Light ( heating ) ( temperature ) modulated DSC ( LMDSC ), developed by Saruyama, offers the advantage that the frequency range for direct measurements is extended (from 0.01 to 1 Hz). However, at frequencies above 0.1 Hz, the results contain information about the changing thermal diffusivity (for samples above 100 μm thick). A complex saw-tooth modulation method , developed by Wunderlich, allows multiple frequencies (over almost one decade) to be measured in a single experiment, thus eliminating effects of sample reproducibility. For studying the frequency dependence during (chemical) transformations, such as cure, the desired invariance of the sample during at least one modulation period and thermal diffusivity effects (even for films of only 100 μm thick) limit a further extension of the frequency domain to lower and higher frequencies, respectively.",

The effect of fill grade of the nanoparticles on the dielectric properties of the nanocomposites is also included. The following fill grades are investigated: 0.2 vol.%, 1 vol.% and 5 vol.%. The results indicate that the higher frequency (1500 Hz) affects the breakdown strength of the samples. The influence changes with the change of the filler concentration. The dielectric loss values of epoxy resin and epoxy-hBN nanocomposites show a significant increase with the increase of frequency. The decrease of the breakdown strength is in line with the increase of the tano.",

At the microwave frequency, said the X-band, the nanocomposites reveal an unexpected diamagnetism. To explain the intriguing phenomenon, we revisit the Debye relaxation law with the memory effect. The magnetization vector of the magnetite is unable to synchronize with the rapidly changing magnetic field, and it contributes to diamagnetism, a negative magnetic susceptibility for nanoparticles. The model just developed and the fitting result can not only be used to explain the experimental data in the X-band but also can be used to estimate the transition frequency between paramagnetism and diamagnetism.",

We performed transmission and reflection measurements from 7 GHz up to 170 GHz with a vector network analyzer equipped with a series of standard horn antennas. Using an empirical model, we analyzed the data to extract complex permittivity and permeability from transmission data; then, we used reflection data to validate the results.

        "content": "The complex permittivity characteristics of epoxy nanocomposite systems were examined and an attempt has been made to understand the underlying physics governing some of the unique macroscopic dielectric behaviors. The experimental investigations were performed using two different nanocomposite systems with low filler concentrations over the frequency range of 10-2-400 Hz, but for some cases, the data has been reported upto 106 Hz for a better understanding of the behaviors. Results demonstrate that nanocomposites do possess unique permittivity behaviors as compared to those already known for unfilled polymer and microcomposite systems. The nanocomposite real permittivity and tanδ values are found to be lower than that of unfilled epoxy. In addition, results show that interfacial polarization and charge carrier mobilities are suppressed in epoxy nanocomposite systems. The complex permittivity spectra coupled with the ac conductivity characteristics with respect to frequency was found to be sufficient to identify several of the nanocomposite characteristics like the reduction in permittivity values, reduction in the interfacial polarization mechanisms and the electrical conduction behaviors. Analysis of the results are also performed using electric modulus formalisms and it has been seen that the nanocomposite dielectric behaviors at low frequencies can also be explained clearly using this formalism.",

When switching to a newer device with upgraded functions, therapy completely failed.

CPAP manufacturers may put on the market new devices with supposedly better algorithms that in fact may have escaped serious pre-marketing evaluation and that may jeopardize the efficacy of a well proven treatment.

In situ frequency tuning and impedance matching of the resonator circuit using voltage-tunable capacitors (varactors) is needed to optimize read-out sensitivity, but the performance of conventional semiconductor- and ferroelectric-based varactors degrades substantially in the millikelvin temperature range relevant for solid-state quantum devices. Here we show that strontium titanate and potassium tantalate, materials which can exhibit quantum paraelectric behaviour with large field-tunable permittivity at low temperatures, can be used to make varactors with perfect impedance matching and resonator frequency tuning at 6 mK. We characterize the varactors at 6 mK in terms of their capacitance tunability, dissipative losses and magnetic field insensitivity. We use the quantum paraelectric varactors to optimize the radiofrequency read-out of carbon nanotube quantum dot devices, achieving a charge sensitivity of 4.8 μ",

        "content": "The factors that influence the complex permeability of the epoxy—ferrite composite were investigated, and the frequency dispersion behavior model for the complex permeability was proposed. The complex permeability of the composite was measured by an impedance/gain phase analyzer and a network analyzer in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 5 GHz. The permeability of the composite was increased with increasing particle size. The frequency dispersion behavior was found to be dependent on the porosity of the composite at a given particle size and ferrite content. The relaxation curve of the complex permeability became broader and flatter as the porosity increased. The equation proposed in this article coincided with the frequency dispersion behavior of the complex permeability of the composite fairly well. It was also found that the variation of σ and ν had a close relationship with the shape variation of the frequency dispersion curve, and that σ and ν were the parameters related to the porosity, particle size, and particle size distribution. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

        "content": "Noise and electrical transport properties of composites based on epoxy resin filled with various carbon inclusions (single-walled carbon nanotubes, high surface area carbon black, and exfoliated graphite) were investigated in depth. The temperature dependence of resistivity shows that Mott's hopping and tunneling between conductive carbon particles dominate the charge carrier transport at low temperature, whereas a positive temperature coefficient effect occurs at higher temperature. Low-frequency noise spectra of the investigated materials comprise 1/fα type components. The noise level is the highest for composites close to the percolation threshold. The percolation threshold value of the system also strongly impacts both the temperature dependence of the noise level and the resistivity. Close to the percolation threshold, the noise level increases due to the carrier tunneling throughout the polymer matrix and decreases due to the rapid expansion of the polymer matrix. In contrast, the latter has almost no influence on the noise level far above the percolation threshold, and the small kink in the temperature dependence of the noise level indicates a crossover between tunneling and thermally activated electron transport mechanisms.",

In current-clamp recordings, NA increased the firing frequency in response to natural stimuli of responsive VSNs and induced spiking activity in previously unresponsive neurons.

        "content": "A study was conducted on the effect of interleaving on laminated composites. An ethylene-based ionomer of various compositions and a silane-modified ethylene-vinyl-acetate were selected as the interleaving materials. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the ethylene-based polymers ranged from-24 to 50'C. The fracture toughness (GIc), impact performance, and damping properties of the composites were evaluated. G1c of interleaved composites was about 3-5 times higher than that of non-interleaved. However, G1c was sensitive to the composition of the interleaf. The silane-modified ethylenevinyl-acetate had the highest fracture toughness. The impact properties of the interleaved materials were superior to those of non-interleaved, as evident from CAI testing where delamination occurred at an early stage in non-interleaved samples. The damping ratio of interleaved materials was found to be more than 100 times higher than in the original material.",

Thermoplastic and thermoset interleaves sandwiched between graphite/epoxy composite plies were investigated over a wide range of film thicknesses. The fracture process was initiated by the nucleation of microcracks ahead of the crack tip and continued with coalescence of microcracks that finally resulted in unstable fracture. Both types of interleaves enhanced the interlaminar fracture toughness to a great extent, although thermoplastic interleaves were more effective than the thermoset interleaves because of the larger energy-absorbing capability of the thermoplastic polymer. The fracture toughness increased steeply with film thickness at small interleaf thicknesses and leveled off to a relatively constant value at larger film thicknesses. Cohesive failures, microcracking, and plastic deformation in the thermoset interleaf were observed in an optical microscope. The thermoplastic interleaves displayed adhesive failures, a limited degree of microcracking, and material yield.",

The interleaves were either thermoset or thermoplastic films placed at the midplane along the anticipated fracture plane. To examine the possible influence of constraints on the crack tip plastic zone due to the rigid composite plies, a large range of interleaf thick nesses was investigated. At each crack increment, the crack extension initiated close to the maximum load and progressed in a stable manner during the displacement controlled test ing. Fiber bridging was not observed on the fracture specimens, or indicated by the shape of the crack growth resistance curves. The thermoplastic interleaves enhanced the fracture toughness, G IC , to a much larger extent than the thermoset interleaves, due to a larger en ergy absorption capability in the fracture process. For the thermoplastic interleaves, the maximum fracture toughness was achieved at very small film thicknesses. At larger film thicknesses GIC remained large. For the thermoset film material, the enhancement of GIC was only nominal and the thicker thermoset interleaves failed in a film delamination mode, resulting in low GIC values.",

These properties of composite material are the most basic & common attractive features that make them useful for industrial applications. The main objective of this work is to contribute for a better understanding of the static behavior of structure made from fiber reinforced composite materials, specifically for the case of plate structures. The plate model is created using SOLIDWORKS 2017 and then imported into ANSYS R18.1. The study specifically examines three stacking sequences of the composite plate (angle ply, cross ply, and multidirectional ply) to analysis stress and deformation resulted from the loads. The static analysis of a Carbon/Epoxy with honeycomb plate composite reveals that the equivalent stress and deformation are lower in the cross-ply stacking sequence compared to the angle ply and multidirectional ply for the same load carrying capacity. This suggests that the composite plate with a cross ply configuration is more suitable for manufacturing composite structures due to its improved performance.",

        "content": "Understanding the previous protection and restoration efforts and the current state of cultural relics is essential before compiling a conservation and restoration plan. The lack of detailed archival records for some early conservation operations, the identification of restoration materials necessitates the use of scientific analytical methods. In this study, the composition and spatial distribution of historical restoration materials on five iron relics were investigated through pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and ultraviolet-induced visible luminescence imaging (UVL). The relics studied were iron weight 20791, iron adze head 2335, and iron axe 2334 from the Gansu Provincial Museum, iron sword D0008 from the Zhaotong Municipal Museum, and iron sword 450 from the National Museum of China. All five relics had undergone restoration without accompanying archival records. UVL revealed the distribution of various conservation materials. Notably, two distinct layers of the conservation material were observed on iron axe 2334. Differences in the fluorescence color and intensity of iron sword 450 provided information regarding the sampling strategy. The samples were collected under ultraviolet light emitting diode illumination to ensure representativeness and minimize damage to the relics. Through Py-GC/MS, the coating materials for iron weight 20791 and iron adze head 2335 were identified as boiled tung oil mixed with rosin resin. Iron axis 2334 had a two-layer coating: a base layer of boiled tung oil and a top layer of shellac. The coating material for iron sword D0008 was determined to be paraffin wax. The protective layer of iron sword 450 included multiple materials, including shellac, polystyrene, and bisphenol-A-type epoxy resin. This study confirms that UVL combined with Py-GC/MS serves as an effective technique for analyzing historical restoration materials. UVL guided the selection of representative samples for Py-GC/MS, reducing the time and amount of sampling required and minimizing further damage to the relics. This research provides valuable data for the restoration archives of five iron artifacts, offering a scientific basis for conservators to evaluate conservation methods, devise future conservation strategies, and exclude ineffective conservation materials.",

This work presents integrated investigations of the lignocellulosic date palm/epoxy composites at various reinforcement condition parameters for sustainable structural materials where elemental mapping, topological analysis, and mechanical performance have been performed. Mapping energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was utilized to assess the composite composition properly. Elemental mapping and a scanning electron microscope were employed to evaluate the chemical composition of the composites. The mechanical performance of the produced composites was also explored in terms of ultimate tensile strength, tensile modulus, elongation at break, and impact energy properties. The effects of fiber loading, fiber length, and fiber width (as long fiber, short fiber, and long-thin fiber) were investigated for the date palm fiber/epoxy composites. Results have revealed that the composite behavior was affected by several influential reinforcement parameters. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy maps by C-K, O-K, Si-K, K-K, and Ca-K demonstrated that the composites contain mainly carbon, silicon, and oxygen. It was evident that the modulus of elasticity property of short fiber composites exhibits an increasing trend with higher fiber content, even at 35 wt%. Moreover, the enhancement of tensile strength for the short fiber size composites reached 72.5 %. However, such tensile strength of thin fiber size/epoxy composites achieved 135.7 % at 25 wt% indicating superior development of this mechanical property. The long date palm fiber composites demonstrated the best value of modulus of elasticity and the maximum impact energy of 15.3 kJ/m",

        "content": "Decoctions of Ferula orientalis L. (Apiaceae), have been traditionally used to lower blood glucose levels (BGLs). After in vitro enzyme inhibition tests on the dichloromethane extracts of the roots (FOD) and the methanol extract of the roots (FOM), isolation studies were carried out on the FOD extract. The anti-hyperglycemic effects of the FOD extract and the pure compounds were studied in mice using the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) models. Molecular docking studies were performed on potent compounds in the binding pockets of enzymes α-glucosidase and α-amylase. The isolations of 11 compounds were isolated from the FOD extract, which comprised teferidine (1), ferutinin (FT) (2), teferin (3), epoxy-jaeschkeanadiol-p-hydroxybenzoate (4), epoxy-jaeschkeanadiol-6-vanillate (5), tovarol-8-angelate (6), leucoferin (7), tovarol-8-p-hydroxybenzoate (8), tovarol-8-vanillate (9), 6-β-p-hydroxybenzoyloxy-germacra-1(10),4-diene (10), and chimgin (11). Compounds 2 and 8-11 exhibited a higher inhibitory activity on α-glucosidase. In the OGTT, pretreatment with the FOD extract or compound 2 did not alter the BGLs after administration of the glucose solution compared to the control. In the STZ-induced diabetic mice model, no significant difference in the BGLs was observed with the FOD extract (200 mg/kg) or compound 2 (100 mg/kg)-treated diabetic mice compared to the diabetic control mice. The experimental studies all showed that the F. orientalis extract had significant effects on the enzyme systems involved in DM, and it would be appropriate to plan further studies on possible problems of bioavailability of the compound FT and the FOD extract, inadequate dose, and duration of administration.",

        "content": "Thin cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) foils were used as intrinsic thermoplastic healing agents in carbon fiber (CF)-reinforced epoxy laminates. COC films were produced by hot pressing and were interleaved in the interlaminar regions between each EP/CF lamina, during the hand layup fabrication of the laminates. Three samples were produced, i.e., the neat EP/CF laminate without COC, and two laminates containing COC layers with a thickness of 44 μm and 77 μm, respectively. It was observed that the fiber volume fraction decreased, and the porosity increased with the introduction of COC layers, and this effect was more evident when thick films were used. These two effects, combined with the sub-optimal adhesion between COC and EP, caused a decrease in the mechanical properties (i.e., the elastic modulus, flexural strength, interlaminar shear strength and interlaminar fracture toughness) of the laminates. Specimens subjected to mode I interlaminar fracture toughness test were then thermally mended under pressure by resistive heating, through the Joule effect of conductive CFs. A temperature of approximately 190 °C was reached during the healing treatment. The healing efficiency was evaluated as the ratio of critical strain energy release rate (GIC) of the healed and virgin specimens. Healed specimens containing COC layers of 44 μm and 77 μm exhibited a healing efficiency of 164% and 100%, respectively. As expected, the healing treatment was not beneficial for the neat EP/CF laminate without COC, which experienced a healing efficiency of only 2%. This result proved the efficacy of COC layers as a healing agent for EP/CF laminates, and the effectiveness of resistive heating as a way to activate the intrinsic healing mechanism.",

The introduction of the PEAA layer significantly improved the damping capability. The effectiveness of interleaving increased with the flexural modulus of the outer layers. In the case of unidirectional laminates, calculations based on a sandwich structure of isotropic layers quantitatively reproduced this trend. In the case of angle-ply laminates, however, the model predicted only part of the improvement experimentally observed. This was explained in terms of the bending of the angle-ply laminates in the transverse direction which would induce additional deformations in the interleaf layer and was not accounted for by the present model.",

The impact penetration energy of the unidirectional composite beam increased strongly upon interleaving. Realtime observations using a microscope in a static flexure test indicated a dramatic change of failure mode from the dominantly compressive fracture of the baseline laminate to the dominantly tensile fracture process upon interleaving, in accordance with the corresponding fractographic features of the impact specimens. These observations were attributed to the change in stress distribution upon introduction of the interleaf layer.

Significant increases in delamination resistance were found in all modes of loading when 50 and 200 μm thick layers of the resin were placed in the central crack path of the laminates. The fracture data were fitted to a simple failure criterion and related to the predicted plastic zone sizes. Fractographic examination documents the gradual change in the micromechanisms of failure as the imposed loading mode changes. The crack path is observed to oscillate between the two ply boundaries, via the resin-rich layer, raising questions as to the micromechanical interpretation of the fracture data.",

        "content": "In this study, numerical modeling through the cohesive zone theory was performed to simulate the end notch flexure (ENF) test with same conditions of the experimental results of previous study that investigated the effect of a carbon nanotube (CNT)/epoxy film in carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite through the mode II interlaminar fracture toughness of a non-interleaved, epoxy film interleaved, CNT/epoxy film interleaved CFRP laminate specimen. The effect of the presence of CNT/epoxy film interleave on a composite laminate was modeled. The influence of the interleave cohesive parameters was studied to link the parameters to the material strength and energy release rate. Cohesive parameter identification was performed by matching the initial loading and the damage evolution phase by dividing the cohesive zones into cohesive front and remaining cohesive zones. This is because, when modeling with a single cohesive zone, the critical load point that causes delamination or the curve after load drop do not match the experimental values. Results showed that the divided cohesive zone model is in good agreement with the experimental results and that there is a clear relationship between the cohesive energy of the interface and CNT/epoxy film parameters.",

        "content": "To evaluate the fracture load of bilayer ceramic crowns manufactured by Rapid Layer Technology (RLT) after different cementation protocols of the veneering ceramic to the zirconia infrastructures. Sixty epoxy resin preparations simulating a molar tooth were obtained and 60 zirconia infrastructures and feldspathic crowns were manufactured by RLT and divided into 6 groups according to the cementation protocol at the interface to veneering ceramic (n=10): Ctr- control: conventional resin cement; Al- Al2O3 sandblasting 50µm + conventional resin cement; Al/MDP- Al2O3 sandblasting (50µm) + resin cement with MDP; Sil- silicatization 30µm + conventional resin cement; Gl/HF- glaze + hydrofluoridric acid (5%,60s) + silane + conventional resin cement; Gl- glazing as bonding agent. The feldspathic ceramic internal surface was etched with fluoridric acid (5%) + silane followed by cementation according to respective protocols. All samples were mechanically cycled (200N and 4.5x105 Pa, 37°C, 2x106 cycles, 3.4Hz) and submitted to axial compressing fracture load test (10kN, 0.5mm/min). The results(N) were submitted to descriptive and analytical statistical analysis with 1-way ANOVA, Weibull, and the Tukey test (α=0.05). ANOVA revealed that there was a significant difference among the tested groups (p<0.0001). The group Al/MDP presented the higher resistance to fracture (1972.46A N), followed by the Ctr group (1584.41B N). The characteristic strength(σ0) was significantly different (p=0.000). The crack and chipping were the predominant failures. The air-abrasion at the external surface of zirconia with Al2O3 followed by cementation with MDP resin cement, should be selected to Rapid Layer Technique when felspathic ceramic is used as veneer ceramic.",

When switching to a newer device with upgraded functions, therapy completely failed. A video recording performed by the patient's wife showed high frequency mask movements suggesting inability to maintain a therapeutic pressure with high frequency pressure fluctuations, confirmed afterwards during full night polysomnography and in a bench study. CPAP manufacturers may put on the market new devices with supposedly better algorithms that in fact may have escaped serious pre-marketing evaluation and that may jeopardize the efficacy of a well proven treatment. We suggest that better evaluations are necessary before marketing therapeutic devices, and that post-marketing assessment of unanticipated side effects should become the norm.",

        "content": "Radiofrequency reflectometry can provide fast and sensitive electrical read-out of charge and spin qubits in quantum dot devices coupled to resonant circuits. In situ frequency tuning and impedance matching of the resonator circuit using voltage-tunable capacitors (varactors) is needed to optimize read-out sensitivity, but the performance of conventional semiconductor- and ferroelectric-based varactors degrades substantially in the millikelvin temperature range relevant for solid-state quantum devices. Here we show that strontium titanate and potassium tantalate, materials which can exhibit quantum paraelectric behaviour with large field-tunable permittivity at low temperatures, can be used to make varactors with perfect impedance matching and resonator frequency tuning at 6 mK. We characterize the varactors at 6 mK in terms of their capacitance tunability, dissipative losses and magnetic field insensitivity. We use the quantum paraelectric varactors to optimize the radiofrequency read-out of carbon nanotube quantum dot devices, achieving a charge sensitivity of 4.8 μ",

        "content": "In this work, echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) with flyback readout gradient-echo train was implemented in a preclinical MR scanner. The aim of this study is to visualize and quantify the ghost spectral lines produced by two, three and four interleaved echo trains with different amplitudes of the readout gradients, and to investigate the feasibility of the flyback data acquisition in micro-imaging of small animals. Applied multi-slice EPSI sequence utilizes asymmetric gradient-echo train that combines the shortest possible rewind gradients with readout gradients. It simplifies data processing because all echoes are acquired with the same polarity of the readout gradient. The approach with four interleaved gradient-echo trains and with four echoes in each train provides broad spectral bandwidth in combination with narrow receiver bandwidth and a good water-fat signal separation. It improves signal-to-noise ratio without the undesired consequence of water-fat shift artifacts that are eliminated during data processing. Position, number, and intensity of the ghost spectral lines can be controlled by the suitable choice of spectral bandwidth, number of echo train interleaves, and the number of echoes in each interleave. This study demonstrates that high-spatial resolution EPSI with interleaved flyback readout gradient-echo trains is feasible on standard preclinical scanners.",

        "content": "Using acoustic vortex tweezers (AVT) to spatially accumulate microbubbles (MBs) shows promise for enhancing drug delivery efficiency and reducing off-target effects. The strong echogenicity of accumulated MBs also improves diagnostics via conventional ultrasound (US) B-mode imaging. However, the annular high-pressure distribution of AVT inhibits MBs inflow at the inlet, reducing MBs collection. The spatial resolution of US B-mode imaging further limits theranostic applications of AVT-mediated MBs accumulation. To address these challenges, we integrated an AVT waveform with volumetric super-resolution imaging (VSRI) to monitor the dynamic growth of MBs cluster during accumulation. We used a 5-MHz 2D array transducer for VSRI, employing plane wave pulses interleaved with accumulating pulses to retain MBs at a flow rate of 0.023-0.047 mL/s in a 3-mm vessel phantom. An asymmetrical AVT waveform (AVT*) was produced by modulating the pressure at the MBs inlet compared to the outlet. The effectiveness was validated in rat cerebral vessels for real-time volumetric tracking of MBs clusters. Microscopy observations showed that AVT* could quickly gather flowing MBs into cluster without repelling them at a flow rate of 0.023 mL/s. Statistical results indicated that microscopic data correlated better with VSRI than with B-mode images, suggesting VSRI suffices to detect the dynamics of AVT*-actuated MBs accumulation in real-time. Additionally, VSRI detected a significant increase in MBs cluster size over time during AVT* in the superior sagittal sinus of the rat brain. These findings demonstrate that the proposed strategy can accumulate the flowing MBs at a desired location and simultaneously observe this phenomenon.",

        "title": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Evaluation and Classification of Vascular Malformations.",
        "content": "Introduction Vascular malformations of the soft tissues are a diverse collection of lesions frequently encountered in clinical practice. Vascular malformations are rare and complex abnormalities that affect both children and young adults. Low-flow malformations are more common in children and often become symptomatic in later years. These malformations are common causes of soft tissue masses in children and can affect any part of the body at any age. Significant advancements in the management of these conditions have been made due to the implementation of a comprehensive binary categorization system, which classifies vascular abnormalities into tumors and malformations based on their clinicopathological characteristics. Imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plays a crucial role in the accurate identification, localization, and classification of these lesions, aiding in the development of appropriate treatment plans. Materials and methods This prospective study was conducted at Dr. D. Y. Patil Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, Pimpri, Pune, from August 2022 to June 2024. Fifty patients of all age groups with clinically suspected soft tissue vascular malformations were included. MRI was performed using a MAGNETOM Vida (3T) Scanner (Siemens Healthcare Private Limited, Mumbai, India), and ultrasound was used as an adjunct. Institutional Ethics Committee clearance and informed consent were obtained. The study employed various MRI sequences, including T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) fast spin echo (FSE), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) FSE, short tau inversion recovery (STIR), T2-weighted gradient recalled echo (GRE), pre-contrast fat-saturated T1WI, 3D post-contrast T1WI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and ANGIO TWIST (time-resolved angiography with interleaved stochastic trajectories) ISO. Results The study included 50 patients, with a male predominance of 28 (56%). The mean age was 22.13 years, and the average duration of vascular malformations was 32.94 months. The swelling was present in 43 (86%) of patients, and 35 (70%) had superficial lesions. MRI findings revealed hypointensity on T1 imaging in 40 (80%) patients and hyperintensity on T2 imaging in 49 (98%) cases. STIR sequences showed hyperintensity in all patients. The most common type of vascular malformation was slow-flow 46 (92%), with venous malformations being the most prevalent 39 (78%). Conclusion MRI is a valuable imaging modality for the evaluation and classification of vascular malformations, providing detailed information on lesion extent and involvement of surrounding tissues. The findings support the use of MRI as a primary tool in the assessment of vascular malformations, with ultrasound serving as a useful adjunct in certain cases. Further studies with larger sample sizes are recommended to validate these findings and refine imaging protocols.",

        "title": "Neural Mechanisms of Learning and Consolidation of Morphologically Derived Words in a Novel Language: Evidence From Hebrew Speakers.",
        "content": "We examined neural mechanisms associated with the learning of novel morphologically derived words in native Hebrew speakers within the Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) framework. Across four sessions, 28 participants were trained on an artificial language, which included two types of morphologically complex words: linear (root + suffix) with a salient structure, and non-linear (root interleaved with template), with a prominent derivational structure in participants' first language (L1). A third simple monomorphemic condition, which served as baseline, was also included. On the first and fourth sessions, training was followed by testing in an fMRI scanner. Our behavioural results showed decomposition of both types of complex words, with the linear structure more easily learned than the non-linear structure. Our fMRI results showed involvement of frontal areas, associated with decomposition, only for the non-linear condition, after just the first session. We also observed training-related increases in activation in temporal areas specifically for the non-linear condition, which was correlated with participants' L1 morphological awareness. These results demonstrate that morphological decomposition of derived words occurs in the very early stages of word learning, is influenced by L1 experience, and can facilitate word learning. However, in contrast to the CLS framework, we found no support for a shift from reliance on hippocampus to reliance on cortical areas in any of our conditions. Instead, our findings align more closely with recent theories showing a positive correlation between changes in hippocampus and cortical areas, suggesting that these representations co-exist and continue to interact with one another beyond initial learning.",

        "title": "HER4 is a high-affinity dimerization partner for all EGFR/HER/ErbB family proteins.",
        "content": "Human epidermal growth factor receptors (HER)-also known as EGFR or ErbB receptors-are a subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that play crucial roles in cell growth, division, and differentiation. HER4 (ErbB4) is the least studied member of this family, partly because its expression is lower in later stages of development. Recent work has suggested that HER4 can play a role in metastasis by regulating cell migration and invasiveness; however, unlike EGFR and HER2, the precise role that HER4 plays in tumorigenesis is still unresolved. Early work on HER family proteins suggested that there are direct interactions between the four members, but to date, there has been no single study of all four receptors in the same cell line with the same biophysical method. Here, we quantitatively measure the degree of association between HER4 and the other HER family proteins in live cells with a time-resolved fluorescence technique called pulsed interleaved excitation fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (PIE-FCCS). PIE-FCCS is sensitive to the oligomerization state of membrane proteins in live cells, while simultaneously measuring single-cell protein expression levels and diffusion coefficients. Our PIE-FCCS results demonstrate that HER4 interacts directly with all HER family members in the cell plasma membrane. The interaction between HER4 and other HER family members intensified in the presence of a HER4-specific ligand. Our work suggests that HER4 is a preferred dimerization partner for all HER family proteins, even in the absence of ligands.",

        "content": "Independent control of electromagnetic (EM) waves by metasurfaces for multiple tasks are highly desired and is the recent hot topic of research. In this work we contribute a polarization insensitive frequency multiplexed 2-bit coding metasurface to control the Terahertz (THz) waves in the two operating bands independently. In this regard, as a first step a cascaded meta-atom composed of square rings and/or square metallic patches separated by two polyimide substrates is designed and optimized that provides sixteen independent distinct discrete phases in the reflection geometry. These meta-atoms are then distributed with distinct coding sequences in the two-dimensional spatial plane to realize various bi-functional metasurfaces. As a proof of the concept various full structures are designed and simulated to realize a series of bi-functionalities including anomalous reflection/beam shaping, beam shaping/anomalous reflection, beam deflection/Orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam generation with distinct modes and propagating wave to surface wave (PW-SW) conversion/PW beam manipulation in the lower and higher THz bands, respectively. All the simulation results are in excellent agreement with their theoretical equivalents. We envision that the proposed meta-designs have potential applications for the multi-spectral control of EM waves in THz band. The idea can be further extended to design frequency dependent tri-functional and multi-functional THz meta-devices.",

        "content": "We all possess a mental library of schemas that specify how different types of events unfold. How are these schemas acquired? A key challenge is that learning a new schema can catastrophically interfere with old knowledge. One solution to this dilemma is to use interleaved training to learn a single representation that accommodates all schemas. However, another class of models posits that catastrophic interference can be avoided by splitting off new representations when large prediction errors occur. A key differentiating prediction is that, according to splitting models, catastrophic interference can be prevented even under blocked training curricula. We conducted a series of semi-naturalistic experiments and simulations with Bayesian and neural network models to compare the predictions made by the \"splitting\" versus \"non-splitting\" hypotheses of schema learning. We found better performance in blocked compared to interleaved curricula, and explain these results using a Bayesian model that incorporates representational splitting in response to large prediction errors. In a follow-up experiment, we validated the model prediction that inserting blocked training early in learning leads to better learning performance than inserting blocked training later in learning. Our results suggest that different learning environments (i.e., curricula) play an important role in shaping schema composition.",

When switching to a newer device with upgraded functions, therapy completely failed. A video recording performed by the patient's wife showed high frequency mask movements suggesting inability to maintain a therapeutic pressure with high frequency pressure fluctuations, confirmed afterwards during full night polysomnography and in a bench study. CPAP manufacturers may put on the market new devices with supposedly better algorithms that in fact may have escaped serious pre-marketing evaluation and that may jeopardize the efficacy of a well proven treatment. We suggest that better evaluations are necessary before marketing therapeutic devices, and that post-marketing assessment of unanticipated side effects should become the norm.",

        "content": "Radiofrequency reflectometry can provide fast and sensitive electrical read-out of charge and spin qubits in quantum dot devices coupled to resonant circuits. In situ frequency tuning and impedance matching of the resonator circuit using voltage-tunable capacitors (varactors) is needed to optimize read-out sensitivity, but the performance of conventional semiconductor- and ferroelectric-based varactors degrades substantially in the millikelvin temperature range relevant for solid-state quantum devices. Here we show that strontium titanate and potassium tantalate, materials which can exhibit quantum paraelectric behaviour with large field-tunable permittivity at low temperatures, can be used to make varactors with perfect impedance matching and resonator frequency tuning at 6 mK. We characterize the varactors at 6 mK in terms of their capacitance tunability, dissipative losses and magnetic field insensitivity. We use the quantum paraelectric varactors to optimize the radiofrequency read-out of carbon nanotube quantum dot devices, achieving a charge sensitivity of 4.8 μ",

        "content": "Nowadays, convectional metallic material replaced by composite materials, because composite materials have superior than metallic materials properties such as light weights, higher strength-to-weight ratio, high tensile strength, Low cost, greater design flexibility, better fatigue resistance, renewability, and biodegradability. These properties of composite material are the most basic & common attractive features that make them useful for industrial applications. The main objective of this work is to contribute for a better understanding of the static behavior of structure made from fiber reinforced composite materials, specifically for the case of plate structures. The plate model is created using SOLIDWORKS 2017 and then imported into ANSYS R18.1. The study specifically examines three stacking sequences of the composite plate (angle ply, cross ply, and multidirectional ply) to analysis stress and deformation resulted from the loads. The static analysis of a Carbon/Epoxy with honeycomb plate composite reveals that the equivalent stress and deformation are lower in the cross-ply stacking sequence compared to the angle ply and multidirectional ply for the same load carrying capacity. This suggests that the composite plate with a cross ply configuration is more suitable for manufacturing composite structures due to its improved performance.",

        "content": "Understanding the previous protection and restoration efforts and the current state of cultural relics is essential before compiling a conservation and restoration plan. The lack of detailed archival records for some early conservation operations, the identification of restoration materials necessitates the use of scientific analytical methods. In this study, the composition and spatial distribution of historical restoration materials on five iron relics were investigated through pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and ultraviolet-induced visible luminescence imaging (UVL). The relics studied were iron weight 20791, iron adze head 2335, and iron axe 2334 from the Gansu Provincial Museum, iron sword D0008 from the Zhaotong Municipal Museum, and iron sword 450 from the National Museum of China. All five relics had undergone restoration without accompanying archival records. UVL revealed the distribution of various conservation materials. Notably, two distinct layers of the conservation material were observed on iron axe 2334. Differences in the fluorescence color and intensity of iron sword 450 provided information regarding the sampling strategy. The samples were collected under ultraviolet light emitting diode illumination to ensure representativeness and minimize damage to the relics. Through Py-GC/MS, the coating materials for iron weight 20791 and iron adze head 2335 were identified as boiled tung oil mixed with rosin resin. Iron axis 2334 had a two-layer coating: a base layer of boiled tung oil and a top layer of shellac. The coating material for iron sword D0008 was determined to be paraffin wax. The protective layer of iron sword 450 included multiple materials, including shellac, polystyrene, and bisphenol-A-type epoxy resin. This study confirms that UVL combined with Py-GC/MS serves as an effective technique for analyzing historical restoration materials. UVL guided the selection of representative samples for Py-GC/MS, reducing the time and amount of sampling required and minimizing further damage to the relics. This research provides valuable data for the restoration archives of five iron artifacts, offering a scientific basis for conservators to evaluate conservation methods, devise future conservation strategies, and exclude ineffective conservation materials.",

        "content": "The value of biomaterials for green products has begun to develop more ecofriendly and renewable sustainable materials for a better circular economy and to reduce carbon footprints. This work presents integrated investigations of the lignocellulosic date palm/epoxy composites at various reinforcement condition parameters for sustainable structural materials where elemental mapping, topological analysis, and mechanical performance have been performed. Mapping energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was utilized to assess the composite composition properly. Elemental mapping and a scanning electron microscope were employed to evaluate the chemical composition of the composites. The mechanical performance of the produced composites was also explored in terms of ultimate tensile strength, tensile modulus, elongation at break, and impact energy properties. The effects of fiber loading, fiber length, and fiber width (as long fiber, short fiber, and long-thin fiber) were investigated for the date palm fiber/epoxy composites. Results have revealed that the composite behavior was affected by several influential reinforcement parameters. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy maps by C-K, O-K, Si-K, K-K, and Ca-K demonstrated that the composites contain mainly carbon, silicon, and oxygen. It was evident that the modulus of elasticity property of short fiber composites exhibits an increasing trend with higher fiber content, even at 35 wt%. Moreover, the enhancement of tensile strength for the short fiber size composites reached 72.5 %. However, such tensile strength of thin fiber size/epoxy composites achieved 135.7 % at 25 wt% indicating superior development of this mechanical property. The long date palm fiber composites demonstrated the best value of modulus of elasticity and the maximum impact energy of 15.3 kJ/m",

        "title": "Evaluation of the Antihyperglycemic efficacy of the roots of Ferula orientalis L.: An in vitro to in vivo assessment.",
        "content": "Decoctions of Ferula orientalis L. (Apiaceae), have been traditionally used to lower blood glucose levels (BGLs). After in vitro enzyme inhibition tests on the dichloromethane extracts of the roots (FOD) and the methanol extract of the roots (FOM), isolation studies were carried out on the FOD extract. The anti-hyperglycemic effects of the FOD extract and the pure compounds were studied in mice using the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) models. Molecular docking studies were performed on potent compounds in the binding pockets of enzymes α-glucosidase and α-amylase. The isolations of 11 compounds were isolated from the FOD extract, which comprised teferidine (1), ferutinin (FT) (2), teferin (3), epoxy-jaeschkeanadiol-p-hydroxybenzoate (4), epoxy-jaeschkeanadiol-6-vanillate (5), tovarol-8-angelate (6), leucoferin (7), tovarol-8-p-hydroxybenzoate (8), tovarol-8-vanillate (9), 6-β-p-hydroxybenzoyloxy-germacra-1(10),4-diene (10), and chimgin (11). Compounds 2 and 8-11 exhibited a higher inhibitory activity on α-glucosidase. In the OGTT, pretreatment with the FOD extract or compound 2 did not alter the BGLs after administration of the glucose solution compared to the control. In the STZ-induced diabetic mice model, no significant difference in the BGLs was observed with the FOD extract (200 mg/kg) or compound 2 (100 mg/kg)-treated diabetic mice compared to the diabetic control mice. The experimental studies all showed that the F. orientalis extract had significant effects on the enzyme systems involved in DM, and it would be appropriate to plan further studies on possible problems of bioavailability of the compound FT and the FOD extract, inadequate dose, and duration of administration.",

        "content": "To evaluate the fracture load of bilayer ceramic crowns manufactured by Rapid Layer Technology (RLT) after different cementation protocols of the veneering ceramic to the zirconia infrastructures. Sixty epoxy resin preparations simulating a molar tooth were obtained and 60 zirconia infrastructures and feldspathic crowns were manufactured by RLT and divided into 6 groups according to the cementation protocol at the interface to veneering ceramic (n=10): Ctr- control: conventional resin cement; Al- Al2O3 sandblasting 50µm + conventional resin cement; Al/MDP- Al2O3 sandblasting (50µm) + resin cement with MDP; Sil- silicatization 30µm + conventional resin cement; Gl/HF- glaze + hydrofluoridric acid (5%,60s) + silane + conventional resin cement; Gl- glazing as bonding agent. The feldspathic ceramic internal surface was etched with fluoridric acid (5%) + silane followed by cementation according to respective protocols. All samples were mechanically cycled (200N and 4.5x105 Pa, 37°C, 2x106 cycles, 3.4Hz) and submitted to axial compressing fracture load test (10kN, 0.5mm/min). The results(N) were submitted to descriptive and analytical statistical analysis with 1-way ANOVA, Weibull, and the Tukey test (α=0.05). ANOVA revealed that there was a significant difference among the tested groups (p<0.0001). The group Al/MDP presented the higher resistance to fracture (1972.46A N), followed by the Ctr group (1584.41B N). The characteristic strength(σ0) was significantly different (p=0.000). The crack and chipping were the predominant failures. The air-abrasion at the external surface of zirconia with Al2O3 followed by cementation with MDP resin cement, should be selected to Rapid Layer Technique when felspathic ceramic is used as veneer ceramic.",

When switching to a newer device with upgraded functions, therapy completely failed. A video recording performed by the patient's wife showed high frequency mask movements suggesting inability to maintain a therapeutic pressure with high frequency pressure fluctuations, confirmed afterwards during full night polysomnography and in a bench study. CPAP manufacturers may put on the market new devices with supposedly better algorithms that in fact may have escaped serious pre-marketing evaluation and that may jeopardize the efficacy of a well proven treatment. We suggest that better evaluations are necessary before marketing therapeutic devices, and that post-marketing assessment of unanticipated side effects should become the norm.",

We performed transmission and reflection measurements from 7 GHz up to 170 GHz with a VNA equipped with a series of standard horn antennas. Using an empirical model we analysed the data to extract complex permittivity and permeability from transmission data; then we used reflection data to validate the results. In this paper we present the sample fabrication procedure, analysis method, parameter extraction pipeline, and results for two samples with different epoxy-powder mass ratios.",

At the microwave frequency, said the X-band, the nanocomposites reveal an unexpected diamagnetism. To explain the intriguing phenomenon, we revisit the Debye relaxation law with the memory effect. The magnetization vector of the magnetite is unable to synchronize with the rapidly changing magnetic field, and it contributes to diamagnetism, a negative magnetic susceptibility for nanoparticles. The model just developed and the fitting result can not only be used to explain the experimental data in the X-band but also can be used to estimate the transition frequency between paramagnetism and diamagnetism.",

        "content": "We describe a method for scalable synthesis of epoxy composites with graphene and few-layer graphene fillers, and report on the electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and thermal properties of such composites at elevated temperatures. The tested materials reveal excellent total EMI shielding of ~65 dB (~105 dB) at a thickness of 1 mm(~2 mm) in the X-band frequency range of f=8.2 GHz - 12.4 GHz. The room-temperature cross-plane thermal conductivity of the composite with ~19.5 vol.% of fillers was determined to be ~11.2 W/mK, which is a factor of x41 larger than that of the pristine epoxy. Interestingly, the EMI shielding efficiency improves further as the temperature increases to 520 K while the thermal conductivity remains approximately constant. The excellent EMI shielding and heat conduction characteristics of such multifunctional graphene composites at elevated temperatures are promising for packaging applications of microwave components where EMI shielding and thermal management are important design considerations.",

        "content": "Developing a deep understanding of macroscopic mechanical properties of amorphous systems which lack structural periodicity, has posed a key challenge, not only at the level of theory but also in molecular simulations. Despite significant advancements in computational resources, there is a vast timescale disparity, more than 6 orders of magnitude, between mechanical properties probed in simulations compared to experiments. Using the theoretical framework of non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD), based on the instantaneous normal modes analysis determined through the dynamical matrix of the system, we study the viscoelastic response of a cross-linked epoxy system of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and poly(oxypropylene) diamine, over many orders of magnitude in deformation frequency, below the glass transition temperature. Predictions of the elastic modulus are satisfactorily validated against the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in the high-frequency regime, and against experimental data from dynamic mechanical analysis at frequencies $ \\sim 1 {\\rm Hz}$, hence successfully bridging the timescale gap. The comparison shows that non-affine displacements at the atomic level account for nearly two orders of magnitude reduction in the low-frequency elastic modulus of the polymer glass, compared to affine elasticity estimates. The analysis also reveals the role of internal stresses (as reflected in the instantaneous normal modes), which act as to strengthen the mechanical response.",

In situ frequency tuning and impedance matching of the resonator circuit using voltage-tunable capacitors (varactors) is needed to optimize read-out sensitivity, but the performance of conventional semiconductor- and ferroelectric-based varactors degrades substantially in the millikelvin temperature range relevant for solid-state quantum devices. Here we show that strontium titanate and potassium tantalate, materials which can exhibit quantum paraelectric behaviour with large field-tunable permittivity at low temperatures, can be used to make varactors with perfect impedance matching and resonator frequency tuning at 6 mK. We characterize the varactors at 6 mK in terms of their capacitance tunability, dissipative losses and magnetic field insensitivity. We use the quantum paraelectric varactors to optimize the radiofrequency read-out of carbon nanotube quantum dot devices, achieving a charge sensitivity of 4.8 μ",

        "content": "We fabricated compact low-pass stainless-steel powder filters for use in low-noise measurements at cryogenic temperatures and investigated their attenuation characteristics for different wire lengths, shapes, and preparation methods up to 20 GHz. We used nominally 30-micrometer-sized SUS 304L powder and mixed with Stycast 2850FT by Emerson and Cumming with catalyst 23LV. A 0.1 mm insulated copper wire was wound on preformed powder-mixture spools in the shape of a right-circular cylinder, a flattened elliptic cylinder and a toroid, and the coils were encapsulated in metal tubes or boxes filled with the powder mixture. All the fabricated powder filters showed a large attenuation at high frequencies with a cut-off frequency near 1 GHz. However, the toroidal filter showed prominent ripples corresponding to resonance modes in the 0.5-m-long coil wire. A filter with a 2:1 powder/epoxy mixture mass rate and a wire length of 1.53 m showed an attenuation of -93 dB at 4 GHz and the attenuation was linearly proportional to the wire length. As the powder-to-epoxy ratio increased, the high-frequency attenuation increased. An equally-spaced single-layer coil structure was found to be more efficient in attenuation than a double-layer coil. Geometry of the metal filter-case affected noise ripples with the least noise in a circular-tube case.",

        "content": "Composites of direct-spun carbon nanotube (CNT) mats and epoxy are manufactured and tested in order to determine their mechanical and electrical properties. The mats are spun directly from a floating catalyst, chemical vapour deposition reactor. The volume fraction of epoxy is varied widely by suitable dilution of the epoxy resin with acetone. Subsequent evaporation of the acetone, followed by a cure cycle, leads to composites of varying volume fraction of CNT, epoxy and air. The modulus, strength, electrical conductivity and piezoresistivity of the composites are measured. The CNT mats and their composites exhibit an elastic-plastic stress-strain response under uniaxial tensile loading, and the degree of anisotropy is assessed by testing specimens in 0{\\deg}, 45{\\deg} and 90{\\deg} directions with respect to the draw direction of mat manufacture. The electrical conductivity scales linearly with CNT volume fraction, irrespective of epoxy volume fraction. In contrast, the modulus and strength depend upon both CNT and epoxy volume fractions in a non-linear manner. The macroscopic moduli of the CNT mat-epoxy composites are far below the Voigt bound based on the modulus of CNT walls and epoxy. A micromechanical model is proposed to relate the macroscopic modulus and yield strength of a CNT mat-epoxy composite to the microstructure.",

        "publishedDate": "2023-12-12T10:39:00",
        "content": "Epoxy polymers are used in wide range of applications. The properties and performance of epoxy polymers depend upon various factors like the type of constituents and their proportions used and other process parameters. The conventional way of developing epoxy polymers is usually labor-intensive and may not be fully efficient, which has resulted in epoxy polymers having a limited performance range due to the use of predetermined blend combinations, compositions and development parameters. Hence, in order to experiment with more design parameters, robust and easy computational techniques need to be established. To this end, we developed and analyzed in this study a new machine learning (ML) based approach to predict the mechanical properties of epoxy polymers based on their basic structural features. The results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to derive the ML model. The salient feature of our work is that for the development of epoxy polymers based on EPON-862, several new hardeners were explored in addition to the conventionally used ones. The influence of additional parameters like the proportion of curing agent used and the extent of curing on the mechanical properties of epoxy polymers were also investigated. This method can be further extended by providing the epoxy polymer with the desired properties through knowledge of the structural characteristics of its constituents. The findings of our study can thus lead toward development of efficient design methodologies for epoxy polymeric systems.",

        "content": "Our paper presents the design of a unique annular ring-shaped planar monopole antenna with octal geometry intended for a broad spectrum of frequency applications. Utilizing FR4 epoxy for the substrate and copper material for the top patch, the antenna measures 39 mm $\\times$ 30 mm $\\times$ 1.6 mm. It exhibits resonance at 6.8 GHz, with a return loss of -49.01 dB. The antenna demonstrates a broad frequency range from 2.1 GHz - 13.1 GHz, resulting in an overall -10 dB bandwidth of 11 GHz. At the resonating frequency of 6.8 GHz, the antenna accomplished a total gain of 3.01 dBi and a peak gain of 5.87 dBi at 12.4 GHz. Additionally, it attains a high radiation efficiency of 95.26\\%. The annular patch of the antenna helps distribute the current uniformly at the boundaries of the patch. This helps achieve better current distribution and wider -10 dB bandwidth. This antenna is a versatile replacement for multiple antennas catering to various frequency bands.",

        "content": "We demonstrate that polymer composites with a low loading of graphene, below 1.2 wt. %, are efficient as electromagnetic absorbers in the THz frequency range. The epoxy-based graphene composites were tested at frequencies from 0.25 THz to 4 THz, revealing total shielding effectiveness of 85 dB (1 mm thickness) with graphene loading of 1.2 wt. % at the frequency f=1.6 THz. The THz radiation is mostly blocked by absorption rather than reflection. The efficiency of the THz radiation shielding by the lightweight, electrically insulating composites, increases with increasing frequency. Our results suggest that even the thin-film or spray coatings of graphene composites with thickness in the few-hundred-micrometer range can be sufficient for blocking THz radiation in many practical applications.",

In our experiments, small particles of the potassium ferrocyanide with a 1.25 micron mean size played a role of granules. This compound was enriched by $^{57}$Fe isotope. Particle vibrations in the vibrated resin with the frequency 12.72 MHz were induced by piezo polymer film. At rest, M\\\"{o}ssbauer spectrum of $^{57}$Fe in the potassium ferrocyanide consists of a single line. Ultrasonic vibration of nuclei splits the line into a comb structure with a period equal to the vibration frequency. The spectrum analysis allows to estimate the vibration amplitude of particles and decay of the ultrasound in this medium. The proposed method is unique since it allows to measure subangstrom displacements of particles vibrating with several MHz frequency.",

        "publishedDate": "2018-10-01T16:34:20",
        "content": "This work presents a method to produce structural composites capable of energy storage. They are produced by integrating thin sandwich structures of CNT fiber veils and an ionic liquid-based polymer electrolyte between carbon fiber plies, followed by infusion and curing of an epoxy resin. The resulting structure behaves simultaneously as an electric double-layer capacitor and a structural composite, with flexural modulus of 60 GPa and flexural strength of 153 MPa, combined with 88 mF/g of specific capacitance and the highest power (30 W/kg) and energy (37.5 mWh/kg) densities reported so far for structural supercapacitors. In-situ electrochemical measurements during 4-point bending show that electrochemical performance is retained up to fracture, with minor changes in equivalent series resistance for interleaves under compressive stress. En route to improving interlaminar properties we produce grid-shaped interleaves that enable mechanical interconnection of plies by the stiff epoxy. Synchrotron 3D X-ray tomography analysis of the resulting hierarchical structure confirms the formation of interlaminar epoxy joints. The manuscript discusses encapsulation role of epoxy, demonstrated by charge-discharge measurements of composites immersed in water, a deleterious agent for ionic liquids. Finally, we show different architectures free of current collector and electrical insulators, in which both CNT fiber and CF act as active electrodes.",

        "content": "Nowadays, convectional metallic material replaced by composite materials, because composite materials have superior than metallic materials properties such as light weights, higher strength-to-weight ratio, high tensile strength, Low cost, greater design flexibility, better fatigue resistance, renewability, and biodegradability. These properties of composite material are the most basic & common attractive features that make them useful for industrial applications. The main objective of this work is to contribute for a better understanding of the static behavior of structure made from fiber reinforced composite materials, specifically for the case of plate structures. The plate model is created using SOLIDWORKS 2017 and then imported into ANSYS R18.1. The study specifically examines three stacking sequences of the composite plate (angle ply, cross ply, and multidirectional ply) to analysis stress and deformation resulted from the loads. The static analysis of a Carbon/Epoxy with honeycomb plate composite reveals that the equivalent stress and deformation are lower in the cross-ply stacking sequence compared to the angle ply and multidirectional ply for the same load carrying capacity. This suggests that the composite plate with a cross ply configuration is more suitable for manufacturing composite structures due to its improved performance.",

        "publishedDate": "2019-05-22T11:34:19",
        "content": "The susceptibility to delamination is one of the main concerns in fiber reinforced polymer composites (FRPs). This work demonstrates improvements of 60% in Mode-I fracture toughness after integration of thin (~30 micron), continuous veils of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) directly deposited onto carbon fiber fabric as the CNT are drawn from the gas-phase using a semi-industrial process. A combination of optical imaging, scanning electron microscopy and a Raman spectroscopy provide a new rapid tool to unambiguously determine the crack propagation path by simple visual inspection of fracture surface. The results show that interlaminar crossing between CNT veil/CF interfaces is of paramount importance. The crack front alternatingly propagates above and below the CNT-toughened interlayer, significantly improving the fracture toughness of resultant laminates. This mechanism is strongly influenced by the method used to integrate the veils onto the CF. CNT veils directly deposited onto the fabrics as a low-density layer lead to large improvements in interlaminar properties, whereas compact CNT veils densified by solvent exposure prior to their integration in the lay-up act as defects.",

        "content": "Understanding the previous protection and restoration efforts and the current state of cultural relics is essential before compiling a conservation and restoration plan. The lack of detailed archival records for some early conservation operations, the identification of restoration materials necessitates the use of scientific analytical methods. In this study, the composition and spatial distribution of historical restoration materials on five iron relics were investigated through pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and ultraviolet-induced visible luminescence imaging (UVL). The relics studied were iron weight 20791, iron adze head 2335, and iron axe 2334 from the Gansu Provincial Museum, iron sword D0008 from the Zhaotong Municipal Museum, and iron sword 450 from the National Museum of China. All five relics had undergone restoration without accompanying archival records. UVL revealed the distribution of various conservation materials. Notably, two distinct layers of the conservation material were observed on iron axe 2334. Differences in the fluorescence color and intensity of iron sword 450 provided information regarding the sampling strategy. The samples were collected under ultraviolet light emitting diode illumination to ensure representativeness and minimize damage to the relics. Through Py-GC/MS, the coating materials for iron weight 20791 and iron adze head 2335 were identified as boiled tung oil mixed with rosin resin. Iron axis 2334 had a two-layer coating: a base layer of boiled tung oil and a top layer of shellac. The coating material for iron sword D0008 was determined to be paraffin wax. The protective layer of iron sword 450 included multiple materials, including shellac, polystyrene, and bisphenol-A-type epoxy resin. This study confirms that UVL combined with Py-GC/MS serves as an effective technique for analyzing historical restoration materials. UVL guided the selection of representative samples for Py-GC/MS, reducing the time and amount of sampling required and minimizing further damage to the relics. This research provides valuable data for the restoration archives of five iron artifacts, offering a scientific basis for conservators to evaluate conservation methods, devise future conservation strategies, and exclude ineffective conservation materials.",

        "content": "Composites of direct-spun carbon nanotube (CNT) mats and epoxy are manufactured and tested in order to determine their mechanical and electrical properties. The mats are spun directly from a floating catalyst, chemical vapour deposition reactor. The volume fraction of epoxy is varied widely by suitable dilution of the epoxy resin with acetone. Subsequent evaporation of the acetone, followed by a cure cycle, leads to composites of varying volume fraction of CNT, epoxy and air. The modulus, strength, electrical conductivity and piezoresistivity of the composites are measured. The CNT mats and their composites exhibit an elastic-plastic stress-strain response under uniaxial tensile loading, and the degree of anisotropy is assessed by testing specimens in 0{\\deg}, 45{\\deg} and 90{\\deg} directions with respect to the draw direction of mat manufacture. The electrical conductivity scales linearly with CNT volume fraction, irrespective of epoxy volume fraction. In contrast, the modulus and strength depend upon both CNT and epoxy volume fractions in a non-linear manner. The macroscopic moduli of the CNT mat-epoxy composites are far below the Voigt bound based on the modulus of CNT walls and epoxy. A micromechanical model is proposed to relate the macroscopic modulus and yield strength of a CNT mat-epoxy composite to the microstructure.",

        "content": "Epoxy polymers are used in wide range of applications. The properties and performance of epoxy polymers depend upon various factors like the type of constituents and their proportions used and other process parameters. The conventional way of developing epoxy polymers is usually labor-intensive and may not be fully efficient, which has resulted in epoxy polymers having a limited performance range due to the use of predetermined blend combinations, compositions and development parameters. Hence, in order to experiment with more design parameters, robust and easy computational techniques need to be established. To this end, we developed and analyzed in this study a new machine learning (ML) based approach to predict the mechanical properties of epoxy polymers based on their basic structural features. The results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to derive the ML model. The salient feature of our work is that for the development of epoxy polymers based on EPON-862, several new hardeners were explored in addition to the conventionally used ones. The influence of additional parameters like the proportion of curing agent used and the extent of curing on the mechanical properties of epoxy polymers were also investigated. This method can be further extended by providing the epoxy polymer with the desired properties through knowledge of the structural characteristics of its constituents. The findings of our study can thus lead toward development of efficient design methodologies for epoxy polymeric systems.",

        "publishedDate": "2022-01-10T18:37:35",
        "content": "In this work, we demonstrate that use of dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent leads to better dispersion of graphene nanoplatelets in epoxy matrix compared to acetone solvent, in turn leading to higher thermal conductivity epoxy-graphene nanocomposites. While role of solvents in enabling superior mechanical properties has been addressed before, outlined study is the first to address the effect of solvents on thermal conductivity enhancement and provides novel pathways for achieving high thermal conductivity polymer composite materials. Uniform dispersion of graphene nanoparticles into epoxy can improve thermal contact with polymer leading to superior interface thermal conductance between polymer matrix and graphene. Organic solvents are typically employed to achieve efficient dispersion of graphene into the epoxy matrix. In this study, we compare the effect of two organic solvents, dimethylformamide (DMF) and acetone, in terms of their efficiency in dispersing graphene into the epoxy matrix and their effect on enhancing thermal conductivity of the composite. We find that polymer-graphene composites made with DMF solvent show 44% higher thermal conductivity compared to those made using acetone at 7 weight% filler composition. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) imaging reveals that graphene-epoxy composites, prepared using DMF as solvent, exhibit more uniform dispersion of graphene-nanoplatelets compared to the case of acetone with acetone-based samples exhibiting up to 211% larger graphene agglomerations. Comparison with effective medium theory reveals an almost 35% lower interface thermal resistance between graphene and epoxy for DMF relative to acetone prepared composite. These results provide fundamentally new avenues to achieve higher thermal conductivity graphene-epoxy composites, of key importance for a wide range of thermal management technologies.",

        "content": "The value of biomaterials for green products has begun to develop more ecofriendly and renewable sustainable materials for a better circular economy and to reduce carbon footprints. This work presents integrated investigations of the lignocellulosic date palm/epoxy composites at various reinforcement condition parameters for sustainable structural materials where elemental mapping, topological analysis, and mechanical performance have been performed. Mapping energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was utilized to assess the composite composition properly. Elemental mapping and a scanning electron microscope were employed to evaluate the chemical composition of the composites. The mechanical performance of the produced composites was also explored in terms of ultimate tensile strength, tensile modulus, elongation at break, and impact energy properties. The effects of fiber loading, fiber length, and fiber width (as long fiber, short fiber, and long-thin fiber) were investigated for the date palm fiber/epoxy composites. Results have revealed that the composite behavior was affected by several influential reinforcement parameters. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy maps by C-K, O-K, Si-K, K-K, and Ca-K demonstrated that the composites contain mainly carbon, silicon, and oxygen. It was evident that the modulus of elasticity property of short fiber composites exhibits an increasing trend with higher fiber content, even at 35 wt%. Moreover, the enhancement of tensile strength for the short fiber size composites reached 72.5 %. However, such tensile strength of thin fiber size/epoxy composites achieved 135.7 % at 25 wt% indicating superior development of this mechanical property. The long date palm fiber composites demonstrated the best value of modulus of elasticity and the maximum impact energy of 15.3 kJ/m",

        "publishedDate": "2021-08-02T14:26:14",
        "content": "Epoxy resins are used extensively in composite materials for a wide range of engineering applications, including structural components of aircraft and spacecraft. The processing of fiber-reinforced epoxy composite structures requires carefully selected heating and cooling cycles to fully cure the resin and form strong crosslinked networks. To fully optimize the processing parameters for effective epoxy monomer crosslinking and final product integrity, the evolution of mechanical properties of epoxies during processing must be comprehensively understood. Because the full experimental characterization of these properties as a function of the degree of cure is difficult and time-consuming, efficient computational predictive tools are needed. The objective of this research is to develop an experimentally validated Molecular Dynamics (MD) modeling method, which incorporates a reactive force field, to accurately predict the thermo-mechanical properties of an epoxy resin as a function of the degree of cure. Experimental rheometric and mechanical testing are used to validate an MD model which is subsequently used to predict mass density, shrinkage, elastic properties, and yield strength as a function of the degree of cure. The results indicate that each of the physical and mechanical properties evolve uniquely during the crosslinking process. These results are important for future processing modeling efforts.",

        "title": "Evaluation of the Antihyperglycemic efficacy of the roots of Ferula orientalis L.: An in vitro to in vivo assessment.",
        "content": "Decoctions of Ferula orientalis L. (Apiaceae), have been traditionally used to lower blood glucose levels (BGLs). After in vitro enzyme inhibition tests on the dichloromethane extracts of the roots (FOD) and the methanol extract of the roots (FOM), isolation studies were carried out on the FOD extract. The anti-hyperglycemic effects of the FOD extract and the pure compounds were studied in mice using the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) models. Molecular docking studies were performed on potent compounds in the binding pockets of enzymes α-glucosidase and α-amylase. The isolations of 11 compounds were isolated from the FOD extract, which comprised teferidine (1), ferutinin (FT) (2), teferin (3), epoxy-jaeschkeanadiol-p-hydroxybenzoate (4), epoxy-jaeschkeanadiol-6-vanillate (5), tovarol-8-angelate (6), leucoferin (7), tovarol-8-p-hydroxybenzoate (8), tovarol-8-vanillate (9), 6-β-p-hydroxybenzoyloxy-germacra-1(10),4-diene (10), and chimgin (11). Compounds 2 and 8-11 exhibited a higher inhibitory activity on α-glucosidase. In the OGTT, pretreatment with the FOD extract or compound 2 did not alter the BGLs after administration of the glucose solution compared to the control. In the STZ-induced diabetic mice model, no significant difference in the BGLs was observed with the FOD extract (200 mg/kg) or compound 2 (100 mg/kg)-treated diabetic mice compared to the diabetic control mice. The experimental studies all showed that the F. orientalis extract had significant effects on the enzyme systems involved in DM, and it would be appropriate to plan further studies on possible problems of bioavailability of the compound FT and the FOD extract, inadequate dose, and duration of administration.",

        "publishedDate": "2017-05-12T09:17:02",
        "content": "We present an analytical study of oscillatory laminar shear flow over a compliant viscoelastic layer on a rigid base. This problem relates to oscillating blood flow in viscoelastic vessels. The deeper motivation for this study, however, is the possible use of compliant coatings for turbulent drag reduction. An analytical solution of the fluid and solid velocity is presented, and five dimensionless parameters emerge. The interaction between fluid and solid appears to be determined by a single combined dimensionless parameter, which we call the shear interaction parameter $\\chi$. The fluid satisfies a no-slip boundary condition when $\\left|\\chi\\right| \\rightarrow 0$, which occurs when the solid is heavy, stiff and/or thin. In contrast, the fluid obeys a free-slip boundary condition when $\\left|\\chi\\right| \\rightarrow \\infty$, which corresponds to a lightweight and/or soft solid. Three types of resonance modes are identified for an elastic solid. Two modes (odd and even) are specific to the solid. The third mode results from the coupling with the fluid. The three modes are less pronounced or even absent for a viscoelastic solid. These findings have a twofold use. First, they help to understand the fluid and solid dynamics when shear coupling is important. Second, the presented analytical solution is very useful for validation of numerical fluid-structure-interaction solvers. Future work might include the extension of the theory to multiple viscoelastic layers and the dynamic coupling of normal stresses.",

        "content": "To evaluate the fracture load of bilayer ceramic crowns manufactured by Rapid Layer Technology (RLT) after different cementation protocols of the veneering ceramic to the zirconia infrastructures. Sixty epoxy resin preparations simulating a molar tooth were obtained and 60 zirconia infrastructures and feldspathic crowns were manufactured by RLT and divided into 6 groups according to the cementation protocol at the interface to veneering ceramic (n=10): Ctr- control: conventional resin cement; Al- Al2O3 sandblasting 50µm + conventional resin cement; Al/MDP- Al2O3 sandblasting (50µm) + resin cement with MDP; Sil- silicatization 30µm + conventional resin cement; Gl/HF- glaze + hydrofluoridric acid (5%,60s) + silane + conventional resin cement; Gl- glazing as bonding agent. The feldspathic ceramic internal surface was etched with fluoridric acid (5%) + silane followed by cementation according to respective protocols. All samples were mechanically cycled (200N and 4.5x105 Pa, 37°C, 2x106 cycles, 3.4Hz) and submitted to axial compressing fracture load test (10kN, 0.5mm/min). The results(N) were submitted to descriptive and analytical statistical analysis with 1-way ANOVA, Weibull, and the Tukey test (α=0.05). ANOVA revealed that there was a significant difference among the tested groups (p<0.0001). The group Al/MDP presented the higher resistance to fracture (1972.46A N), followed by the Ctr group (1584.41B N). The characteristic strength(σ0) was significantly different (p=0.000). The crack and chipping were the predominant failures. The air-abrasion at the external surface of zirconia with Al2O3 followed by cementation with MDP resin cement, should be selected to Rapid Layer Technique when felspathic ceramic is used as veneer ceramic.",

CPAP manufacturers may put on the market new devices with supposedly better algorithms that in fact may have escaped serious pre-marketing evaluation and that may jeopardize the efficacy of a well proven treatment.

        "content": "Radiofrequency reflectometry can provide fast and sensitive electrical read-out of charge and spin qubits in quantum dot devices coupled to resonant circuits. In situ frequency tuning and impedance matching of the resonator circuit using voltage-tunable capacitors (varactors) is needed to optimize read-out sensitivity, but the performance of conventional semiconductor- and ferroelectric-based varactors degrades substantially in the millikelvin temperature range relevant for solid-state quantum devices. Here we show that strontium titanate and potassium tantalate, materials which can exhibit quantum paraelectric behaviour with large field-tunable permittivity at low temperatures, can be used to make varactors with perfect impedance matching and resonator frequency tuning at 6 mK. We characterize the varactors at 6 mK in terms of their capacitance tunability, dissipative losses and magnetic field insensitivity. We use the quantum paraelectric varactors to optimize the radiofrequency read-out of carbon nanotube quantum dot devices, achieving a charge sensitivity of 4.8 μ",

        "content": "In this work, echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) with flyback readout gradient-echo train was implemented in a preclinical MR scanner. The aim of this study is to visualize and quantify the ghost spectral lines produced by two, three and four interleaved echo trains with different amplitudes of the readout gradients, and to investigate the feasibility of the flyback data acquisition in micro-imaging of small animals. Applied multi-slice EPSI sequence utilizes asymmetric gradient-echo train that combines the shortest possible rewind gradients with readout gradients. It simplifies data processing because all echoes are acquired with the same polarity of the readout gradient. The approach with four interleaved gradient-echo trains and with four echoes in each train provides broad spectral bandwidth in combination with narrow receiver bandwidth and a good water-fat signal separation. It improves signal-to-noise ratio without the undesired consequence of water-fat shift artifacts that are eliminated during data processing. Position, number, and intensity of the ghost spectral lines can be controlled by the suitable choice of spectral bandwidth, number of echo train interleaves, and the number of echoes in each interleave. This study demonstrates that high-spatial resolution EPSI with interleaved flyback readout gradient-echo trains is feasible on standard preclinical scanners.",

        "content": "Using acoustic vortex tweezers (AVT) to spatially accumulate microbubbles (MBs) shows promise for enhancing drug delivery efficiency and reducing off-target effects. The strong echogenicity of accumulated MBs also improves diagnostics via conventional ultrasound (US) B-mode imaging. However, the annular high-pressure distribution of AVT inhibits MBs inflow at the inlet, reducing MBs collection. The spatial resolution of US B-mode imaging further limits theranostic applications of AVT-mediated MBs accumulation. To address these challenges, we integrated an AVT waveform with volumetric super-resolution imaging (VSRI) to monitor the dynamic growth of MBs cluster during accumulation. We used a 5-MHz 2D array transducer for VSRI, employing plane wave pulses interleaved with accumulating pulses to retain MBs at a flow rate of 0.023-0.047 mL/s in a 3-mm vessel phantom. An asymmetrical AVT waveform (AVT*) was produced by modulating the pressure at the MBs inlet compared to the outlet. The effectiveness was validated in rat cerebral vessels for real-time volumetric tracking of MBs clusters. Microscopy observations showed that AVT* could quickly gather flowing MBs into cluster without repelling them at a flow rate of 0.023 mL/s. Statistical results indicated that microscopic data correlated better with VSRI than with B-mode images, suggesting VSRI suffices to detect the dynamics of AVT*-actuated MBs accumulation in real-time. Additionally, VSRI detected a significant increase in MBs cluster size over time during AVT* in the superior sagittal sinus of the rat brain. These findings demonstrate that the proposed strategy can accumulate the flowing MBs at a desired location and simultaneously observe this phenomenon.",

        "title": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Evaluation and Classification of Vascular Malformations.",
        "content": "Introduction Vascular malformations of the soft tissues are a diverse collection of lesions frequently encountered in clinical practice. Vascular malformations are rare and complex abnormalities that affect both children and young adults. Low-flow malformations are more common in children and often become symptomatic in later years. These malformations are common causes of soft tissue masses in children and can affect any part of the body at any age. Significant advancements in the management of these conditions have been made due to the implementation of a comprehensive binary categorization system, which classifies vascular abnormalities into tumors and malformations based on their clinicopathological characteristics. Imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plays a crucial role in the accurate identification, localization, and classification of these lesions, aiding in the development of appropriate treatment plans. Materials and methods This prospective study was conducted at Dr. D. Y. Patil Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, Pimpri, Pune, from August 2022 to June 2024. Fifty patients of all age groups with clinically suspected soft tissue vascular malformations were included. MRI was performed using a MAGNETOM Vida (3T) Scanner (Siemens Healthcare Private Limited, Mumbai, India), and ultrasound was used as an adjunct. Institutional Ethics Committee clearance and informed consent were obtained. The study employed various MRI sequences, including T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) fast spin echo (FSE), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) FSE, short tau inversion recovery (STIR), T2-weighted gradient recalled echo (GRE), pre-contrast fat-saturated T1WI, 3D post-contrast T1WI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and ANGIO TWIST (time-resolved angiography with interleaved stochastic trajectories) ISO. Results The study included 50 patients, with a male predominance of 28 (56%). The mean age was 22.13 years, and the average duration of vascular malformations was 32.94 months. The swelling was present in 43 (86%) of patients, and 35 (70%) had superficial lesions. MRI findings revealed hypointensity on T1 imaging in 40 (80%) patients and hyperintensity on T2 imaging in 49 (98%) cases. STIR sequences showed hyperintensity in all patients. The most common type of vascular malformation was slow-flow 46 (92%), with venous malformations being the most prevalent 39 (78%). Conclusion MRI is a valuable imaging modality for the evaluation and classification of vascular malformations, providing detailed information on lesion extent and involvement of surrounding tissues. The findings support the use of MRI as a primary tool in the assessment of vascular malformations, with ultrasound serving as a useful adjunct in certain cases. Further studies with larger sample sizes are recommended to validate these findings and refine imaging protocols.",

        "title": "Neural Mechanisms of Learning and Consolidation of Morphologically Derived Words in a Novel Language: Evidence From Hebrew Speakers.",
        "content": "We examined neural mechanisms associated with the learning of novel morphologically derived words in native Hebrew speakers within the Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) framework. Across four sessions, 28 participants were trained on an artificial language, which included two types of morphologically complex words: linear (root + suffix) with a salient structure, and non-linear (root interleaved with template), with a prominent derivational structure in participants' first language (L1). A third simple monomorphemic condition, which served as baseline, was also included. On the first and fourth sessions, training was followed by testing in an fMRI scanner. Our behavioural results showed decomposition of both types of complex words, with the linear structure more easily learned than the non-linear structure. Our fMRI results showed involvement of frontal areas, associated with decomposition, only for the non-linear condition, after just the first session. We also observed training-related increases in activation in temporal areas specifically for the non-linear condition, which was correlated with participants' L1 morphological awareness. These results demonstrate that morphological decomposition of derived words occurs in the very early stages of word learning, is influenced by L1 experience, and can facilitate word learning. However, in contrast to the CLS framework, we found no support for a shift from reliance on hippocampus to reliance on cortical areas in any of our conditions. Instead, our findings align more closely with recent theories showing a positive correlation between changes in hippocampus and cortical areas, suggesting that these representations co-exist and continue to interact with one another beyond initial learning.",

        "content": "Human epidermal growth factor receptors (HER)-also known as EGFR or ErbB receptors-are a subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that play crucial roles in cell growth, division, and differentiation. HER4 (ErbB4) is the least studied member of this family, partly because its expression is lower in later stages of development. Recent work has suggested that HER4 can play a role in metastasis by regulating cell migration and invasiveness; however, unlike EGFR and HER2, the precise role that HER4 plays in tumorigenesis is still unresolved. Early work on HER family proteins suggested that there are direct interactions between the four members, but to date, there has been no single study of all four receptors in the same cell line with the same biophysical method. Here, we quantitatively measure the degree of association between HER4 and the other HER family proteins in live cells with a time-resolved fluorescence technique called pulsed interleaved excitation fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (PIE-FCCS). PIE-FCCS is sensitive to the oligomerization state of membrane proteins in live cells, while simultaneously measuring single-cell protein expression levels and diffusion coefficients. Our PIE-FCCS results demonstrate that HER4 interacts directly with all HER family members in the cell plasma membrane. The interaction between HER4 and other HER family members intensified in the presence of a HER4-specific ligand. Our work suggests that HER4 is a preferred dimerization partner for all HER family proteins, even in the absence of ligands.",

        "content": "Independent control of electromagnetic (EM) waves by metasurfaces for multiple tasks are highly desired and is the recent hot topic of research. In this work we contribute a polarization insensitive frequency multiplexed 2-bit coding metasurface to control the Terahertz (THz) waves in the two operating bands independently. In this regard, as a first step a cascaded meta-atom composed of square rings and/or square metallic patches separated by two polyimide substrates is designed and optimized that provides sixteen independent distinct discrete phases in the reflection geometry. These meta-atoms are then distributed with distinct coding sequences in the two-dimensional spatial plane to realize various bi-functional metasurfaces. As a proof of the concept various full structures are designed and simulated to realize a series of bi-functionalities including anomalous reflection/beam shaping, beam shaping/anomalous reflection, beam deflection/Orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam generation with distinct modes and propagating wave to surface wave (PW-SW) conversion/PW beam manipulation in the lower and higher THz bands, respectively. All the simulation results are in excellent agreement with their theoretical equivalents. We envision that the proposed meta-designs have potential applications for the multi-spectral control of EM waves in THz band. The idea can be further extended to design frequency dependent tri-functional and multi-functional THz meta-devices.",

        "title": "Blocked training facilitates learning of multiple schemas.",
        "content": "We all possess a mental library of schemas that specify how different types of events unfold. How are these schemas acquired? A key challenge is that learning a new schema can catastrophically interfere with old knowledge. One solution to this dilemma is to use interleaved training to learn a single representation that accommodates all schemas. However, another class of models posits that catastrophic interference can be avoided by splitting off new representations when large prediction errors occur. A key differentiating prediction is that, according to splitting models, catastrophic interference can be prevented even under blocked training curricula. We conducted a series of semi-naturalistic experiments and simulations with Bayesian and neural network models to compare the predictions made by the \"splitting\" versus \"non-splitting\" hypotheses of schema learning. We found better performance in blocked compared to interleaved curricula, and explain these results using a Bayesian model that incorporates representational splitting in response to large prediction errors. In a follow-up experiment, we validated the model prediction that inserting blocked training early in learning leads to better learning performance than inserting blocked training later in learning. Our results suggest that different learning environments (i.e., curricula) play an important role in shaping schema composition.",

When switching to a newer device with upgraded functions, therapy completely failed. A video recording performed by the patient's wife showed high frequency mask movements suggesting inability to maintain a therapeutic pressure with high frequency pressure fluctuations, confirmed afterwards during full night polysomnography and in a bench study. CPAP manufacturers may put on the market new devices with supposedly better algorithms that in fact may have escaped serious pre-marketing evaluation and that may jeopardize the efficacy of a well proven treatment. We suggest that better evaluations are necessary before marketing therapeutic devices, and that post-marketing assessment of unanticipated side effects should become the norm.",

        "content": "Radiofrequency reflectometry can provide fast and sensitive electrical read-out of charge and spin qubits in quantum dot devices coupled to resonant circuits. In situ frequency tuning and impedance matching of the resonator circuit using voltage-tunable capacitors (varactors) is needed to optimize read-out sensitivity, but the performance of conventional semiconductor- and ferroelectric-based varactors degrades substantially in the millikelvin temperature range relevant for solid-state quantum devices. Here we show that strontium titanate and potassium tantalate, materials which can exhibit quantum paraelectric behaviour with large field-tunable permittivity at low temperatures, can be used to make varactors with perfect impedance matching and resonator frequency tuning at 6 mK. We characterize the varactors at 6 mK in terms of their capacitance tunability, dissipative losses and magnetic field insensitivity. We use the quantum paraelectric varactors to optimize the radiofrequency read-out of carbon nanotube quantum dot devices, achieving a charge sensitivity of 4.8 μ",

        "content": "A 72-year-old patient had a severe sleep apnea syndrome well controlled for many years through CPAP therapy. When switching to a newer device with upgraded functions, therapy completely failed. A video recording performed by the patient's wife showed high frequency mask movements suggesting inability to maintain a therapeutic pressure with high frequency pressure fluctuations, confirmed afterwards during full night polysomnography and in a bench study. CPAP manufacturers may put on the market new devices with supposedly better algorithms that in fact may have escaped serious pre-marketing evaluation and that may jeopardize the efficacy of a well proven treatment. We suggest that better evaluations are necessary before marketing therapeutic devices, and that post-marketing assessment of unanticipated side effects should become the norm.",

In this context, we fabricated and characterized two samples using different ratios of two easily commercially available materials: epoxy (Stycast 2850FT) and magnetite ($\\mathrm{Fe_{3}O_{4}}$) powder. We performed transmission and reflection measurements from 7 GHz up to 170 GHz with a VNA equipped with a series of standard horn antennas. Using an empirical model we analysed the data to extract complex permittivity and permeability from transmission data; then we used reflection data to validate the results. In this paper we present the sample fabrication procedure, analysis method, parameter extraction pipeline, and results for two samples with different epoxy-powder mass ratios.",

At the microwave frequency, said the X-band, the nanocomposites reveal an unexpected diamagnetism. To explain the intriguing phenomenon, we revisit the Debye relaxation law with the memory effect. The magnetization vector of the magnetite is unable to synchronize with the rapidly changing magnetic field, and it contributes to diamagnetism, a negative magnetic susceptibility for nanoparticles. The model just developed and the fitting result can not only be used to explain the experimental data in the X-band but also can be used to estimate the transition frequency between paramagnetism and diamagnetism.",

        "content": "We describe a method for scalable synthesis of epoxy composites with graphene and few-layer graphene fillers, and report on the electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and thermal properties of such composites at elevated temperatures. The tested materials reveal excellent total EMI shielding of ~65 dB (~105 dB) at a thickness of 1 mm(~2 mm) in the X-band frequency range of f=8.2 GHz - 12.4 GHz. The room-temperature cross-plane thermal conductivity of the composite with ~19.5 vol.% of fillers was determined to be ~11.2 W/mK, which is a factor of x41 larger than that of the pristine epoxy. Interestingly, the EMI shielding efficiency improves further as the temperature increases to 520 K while the thermal conductivity remains approximately constant. The excellent EMI shielding and heat conduction characteristics of such multifunctional graphene composites at elevated temperatures are promising for packaging applications of microwave components where EMI shielding and thermal management are important design considerations.",

        "content": "Developing a deep understanding of macroscopic mechanical properties of amorphous systems which lack structural periodicity, has posed a key challenge, not only at the level of theory but also in molecular simulations. Despite significant advancements in computational resources, there is a vast timescale disparity, more than 6 orders of magnitude, between mechanical properties probed in simulations compared to experiments. Using the theoretical framework of non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD), based on the instantaneous normal modes analysis determined through the dynamical matrix of the system, we study the viscoelastic response of a cross-linked epoxy system of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and poly(oxypropylene) diamine, over many orders of magnitude in deformation frequency, below the glass transition temperature. Predictions of the elastic modulus are satisfactorily validated against the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in the high-frequency regime, and against experimental data from dynamic mechanical analysis at frequencies $ \\sim 1 {\\rm Hz}$, hence successfully bridging the timescale gap. The comparison shows that non-affine displacements at the atomic level account for nearly two orders of magnitude reduction in the low-frequency elastic modulus of the polymer glass, compared to affine elasticity estimates. The analysis also reveals the role of internal stresses (as reflected in the instantaneous normal modes), which act as to strengthen the mechanical response.",

In situ frequency tuning and impedance matching of the resonator circuit using voltage-tunable capacitors (varactors) is needed to optimize read-out sensitivity, but the performance of conventional semiconductor- and ferroelectric-based varactors degrades substantially in the millikelvin temperature range relevant for solid-state quantum devices. Here we show that strontium titanate and potassium tantalate, materials which can exhibit quantum paraelectric behaviour with large field-tunable permittivity at low temperatures, can be used to make varactors with perfect impedance matching and resonator frequency tuning at 6 mK. We characterize the varactors at 6 mK in terms of their capacitance tunability, dissipative losses and magnetic field insensitivity. We use the quantum paraelectric varactors to optimize the radiofrequency read-out of carbon nanotube quantum dot devices, achieving a charge sensitivity of 4.8 μ",

        "content": "We fabricated compact low-pass stainless-steel powder filters for use in low-noise measurements at cryogenic temperatures and investigated their attenuation characteristics for different wire lengths, shapes, and preparation methods up to 20 GHz. We used nominally 30-micrometer-sized SUS 304L powder and mixed with Stycast 2850FT by Emerson and Cumming with catalyst 23LV. A 0.1 mm insulated copper wire was wound on preformed powder-mixture spools in the shape of a right-circular cylinder, a flattened elliptic cylinder and a toroid, and the coils were encapsulated in metal tubes or boxes filled with the powder mixture. All the fabricated powder filters showed a large attenuation at high frequencies with a cut-off frequency near 1 GHz. However, the toroidal filter showed prominent ripples corresponding to resonance modes in the 0.5-m-long coil wire. A filter with a 2:1 powder/epoxy mixture mass rate and a wire length of 1.53 m showed an attenuation of -93 dB at 4 GHz and the attenuation was linearly proportional to the wire length. As the powder-to-epoxy ratio increased, the high-frequency attenuation increased. An equally-spaced single-layer coil structure was found to be more efficient in attenuation than a double-layer coil. Geometry of the metal filter-case affected noise ripples with the least noise in a circular-tube case.",

        "content": "Composites of direct-spun carbon nanotube (CNT) mats and epoxy are manufactured and tested in order to determine their mechanical and electrical properties. The mats are spun directly from a floating catalyst, chemical vapour deposition reactor. The volume fraction of epoxy is varied widely by suitable dilution of the epoxy resin with acetone. Subsequent evaporation of the acetone, followed by a cure cycle, leads to composites of varying volume fraction of CNT, epoxy and air. The modulus, strength, electrical conductivity and piezoresistivity of the composites are measured. The CNT mats and their composites exhibit an elastic-plastic stress-strain response under uniaxial tensile loading, and the degree of anisotropy is assessed by testing specimens in 0{\\deg}, 45{\\deg} and 90{\\deg} directions with respect to the draw direction of mat manufacture. The electrical conductivity scales linearly with CNT volume fraction, irrespective of epoxy volume fraction. In contrast, the modulus and strength depend upon both CNT and epoxy volume fractions in a non-linear manner. The macroscopic moduli of the CNT mat-epoxy composites are far below the Voigt bound based on the modulus of CNT walls and epoxy. A micromechanical model is proposed to relate the macroscopic modulus and yield strength of a CNT mat-epoxy composite to the microstructure.",

        "content": "Epoxy polymers are used in wide range of applications. The properties and performance of epoxy polymers depend upon various factors like the type of constituents and their proportions used and other process parameters. The conventional way of developing epoxy polymers is usually labor-intensive and may not be fully efficient, which has resulted in epoxy polymers having a limited performance range due to the use of predetermined blend combinations, compositions and development parameters. Hence, in order to experiment with more design parameters, robust and easy computational techniques need to be established. To this end, we developed and analyzed in this study a new machine learning (ML) based approach to predict the mechanical properties of epoxy polymers based on their basic structural features. The results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to derive the ML model. The salient feature of our work is that for the development of epoxy polymers based on EPON-862, several new hardeners were explored in addition to the conventionally used ones. The influence of additional parameters like the proportion of curing agent used and the extent of curing on the mechanical properties of epoxy polymers were also investigated. This method can be further extended by providing the epoxy polymer with the desired properties through knowledge of the structural characteristics of its constituents. The findings of our study can thus lead toward development of efficient design methodologies for epoxy polymeric systems.",

Utilizing FR4 epoxy for the substrate and copper material for the top patch, the antenna measures 39 mm $\\times$ 30 mm $\\times$ 1.6 mm. It exhibits resonance at 6.8 GHz, with a return loss of -49.01 dB. The antenna demonstrates a broad frequency range from 2.1 GHz - 13.1 GHz, resulting in an overall -10 dB bandwidth of 11 GHz. At the resonating frequency of 6.8 GHz, the antenna accomplished a total gain of 3.01 dBi and a peak gain of 5.87 dBi at 12.4 GHz. Additionally, it attains a high radiation efficiency of 95.26\\%. The annular patch of the antenna helps distribute the current uniformly at the boundaries of the patch. This helps achieve better current distribution and wider -10 dB bandwidth. This antenna is a versatile replacement for multiple antennas catering to various frequency bands.",

The epoxy-based graphene composites were tested at frequencies from 0.25 THz to 4 THz, revealing total shielding effectiveness of 85 dB (1 mm thickness) with graphene loading of 1.2 wt. % at the frequency f=1.6 THz. The THz radiation is mostly blocked by absorption rather than reflection. The efficiency of the THz radiation shielding by the lightweight, electrically insulating composites, increases with increasing frequency. Our results suggest that even the thin-film or spray coatings of graphene composites with thickness in the few-hundred-micrometer range can be sufficient for blocking THz radiation in many practical applications.",

In our experiments, small particles of the potassium ferrocyanide with a 1.25 micron mean size played a role of granules. This compound was enriched by $^{57}$Fe isotope. Particle vibrations in the vibrated resin with the frequency 12.72 MHz were induced by piezo polymer film. At rest, M\\\"{o}ssbauer spectrum of $^{57}$Fe in the potassium ferrocyanide consists of a single line. Ultrasonic vibration of nuclei splits the line into a comb structure with a period equal to the vibration frequency. The spectrum analysis allows to estimate the vibration amplitude of particles and decay of the ultrasound in this medium. The proposed method is unique since it allows to measure subangstrom displacements of particles vibrating with several MHz frequency.",

        "content": "Nowadays, convectional metallic material replaced by composite materials, because composite materials have superior than metallic materials properties such as light weights, higher strength-to-weight ratio, high tensile strength, Low cost, greater design flexibility, better fatigue resistance, renewability, and biodegradability. These properties of composite material are the most basic & common attractive features that make them useful for industrial applications. The main objective of this work is to contribute for a better understanding of the static behavior of structure made from fiber reinforced composite materials, specifically for the case of plate structures. The plate model is created using SOLIDWORKS 2017 and then imported into ANSYS R18.1. The study specifically examines three stacking sequences of the composite plate (angle ply, cross ply, and multidirectional ply) to analysis stress and deformation resulted from the loads. The static analysis of a Carbon/Epoxy with honeycomb plate composite reveals that the equivalent stress and deformation are lower in the cross-ply stacking sequence compared to the angle ply and multidirectional ply for the same load carrying capacity. This suggests that the composite plate with a cross ply configuration is more suitable for manufacturing composite structures due to its improved performance.",

        "title": "[Identification of conservation and restoration materials for iron relics through ultraviolet-induced visible luminescence imaging and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry].",
        "content": "Understanding the previous protection and restoration efforts and the current state of cultural relics is essential before compiling a conservation and restoration plan. The lack of detailed archival records for some early conservation operations, the identification of restoration materials necessitates the use of scientific analytical methods. In this study, the composition and spatial distribution of historical restoration materials on five iron relics were investigated through pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and ultraviolet-induced visible luminescence imaging (UVL). The relics studied were iron weight 20791, iron adze head 2335, and iron axe 2334 from the Gansu Provincial Museum, iron sword D0008 from the Zhaotong Municipal Museum, and iron sword 450 from the National Museum of China. All five relics had undergone restoration without accompanying archival records. UVL revealed the distribution of various conservation materials. Notably, two distinct layers of the conservation material were observed on iron axe 2334. Differences in the fluorescence color and intensity of iron sword 450 provided information regarding the sampling strategy. The samples were collected under ultraviolet light emitting diode illumination to ensure representativeness and minimize damage to the relics. Through Py-GC/MS, the coating materials for iron weight 20791 and iron adze head 2335 were identified as boiled tung oil mixed with rosin resin. Iron axis 2334 had a two-layer coating: a base layer of boiled tung oil and a top layer of shellac. The coating material for iron sword D0008 was determined to be paraffin wax. The protective layer of iron sword 450 included multiple materials, including shellac, polystyrene, and bisphenol-A-type epoxy resin. This study confirms that UVL combined with Py-GC/MS serves as an effective technique for analyzing historical restoration materials. UVL guided the selection of representative samples for Py-GC/MS, reducing the time and amount of sampling required and minimizing further damage to the relics. This research provides valuable data for the restoration archives of five iron artifacts, offering a scientific basis for conservators to evaluate conservation methods, devise future conservation strategies, and exclude ineffective conservation materials.",

        "content": "The value of biomaterials for green products has begun to develop more ecofriendly and renewable sustainable materials for a better circular economy and to reduce carbon footprints. This work presents integrated investigations of the lignocellulosic date palm/epoxy composites at various reinforcement condition parameters for sustainable structural materials where elemental mapping, topological analysis, and mechanical performance have been performed. Mapping energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was utilized to assess the composite composition properly. Elemental mapping and a scanning electron microscope were employed to evaluate the chemical composition of the composites. The mechanical performance of the produced composites was also explored in terms of ultimate tensile strength, tensile modulus, elongation at break, and impact energy properties. The effects of fiber loading, fiber length, and fiber width (as long fiber, short fiber, and long-thin fiber) were investigated for the date palm fiber/epoxy composites. Results have revealed that the composite behavior was affected by several influential reinforcement parameters. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy maps by C-K, O-K, Si-K, K-K, and Ca-K demonstrated that the composites contain mainly carbon, silicon, and oxygen. It was evident that the modulus of elasticity property of short fiber composites exhibits an increasing trend with higher fiber content, even at 35 wt%. Moreover, the enhancement of tensile strength for the short fiber size composites reached 72.5 %. However, such tensile strength of thin fiber size/epoxy composites achieved 135.7 % at 25 wt% indicating superior development of this mechanical property. The long date palm fiber composites demonstrated the best value of modulus of elasticity and the maximum impact energy of 15.3 kJ/m",

        "title": "Evaluation of the Antihyperglycemic efficacy of the roots of Ferula orientalis L.: An in vitro to in vivo assessment.",
        "content": "Decoctions of Ferula orientalis L. (Apiaceae), have been traditionally used to lower blood glucose levels (BGLs). After in vitro enzyme inhibition tests on the dichloromethane extracts of the roots (FOD) and the methanol extract of the roots (FOM), isolation studies were carried out on the FOD extract. The anti-hyperglycemic effects of the FOD extract and the pure compounds were studied in mice using the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) models. Molecular docking studies were performed on potent compounds in the binding pockets of enzymes α-glucosidase and α-amylase. The isolations of 11 compounds were isolated from the FOD extract, which comprised teferidine (1), ferutinin (FT) (2), teferin (3), epoxy-jaeschkeanadiol-p-hydroxybenzoate (4), epoxy-jaeschkeanadiol-6-vanillate (5), tovarol-8-angelate (6), leucoferin (7), tovarol-8-p-hydroxybenzoate (8), tovarol-8-vanillate (9), 6-β-p-hydroxybenzoyloxy-germacra-1(10),4-diene (10), and chimgin (11). Compounds 2 and 8-11 exhibited a higher inhibitory activity on α-glucosidase. In the OGTT, pretreatment with the FOD extract or compound 2 did not alter the BGLs after administration of the glucose solution compared to the control. In the STZ-induced diabetic mice model, no significant difference in the BGLs was observed with the FOD extract (200 mg/kg) or compound 2 (100 mg/kg)-treated diabetic mice compared to the diabetic control mice. The experimental studies all showed that the F. orientalis extract had significant effects on the enzyme systems involved in DM, and it would be appropriate to plan further studies on possible problems of bioavailability of the compound FT and the FOD extract, inadequate dose, and duration of administration.",

        "content": "To evaluate the fracture load of bilayer ceramic crowns manufactured by Rapid Layer Technology (RLT) after different cementation protocols of the veneering ceramic to the zirconia infrastructures. Sixty epoxy resin preparations simulating a molar tooth were obtained and 60 zirconia infrastructures and feldspathic crowns were manufactured by RLT and divided into 6 groups according to the cementation protocol at the interface to veneering ceramic (n=10): Ctr- control: conventional resin cement; Al- Al2O3 sandblasting 50µm + conventional resin cement; Al/MDP- Al2O3 sandblasting (50µm) + resin cement with MDP; Sil- silicatization 30µm + conventional resin cement; Gl/HF- glaze + hydrofluoridric acid (5%,60s) + silane + conventional resin cement; Gl- glazing as bonding agent. The feldspathic ceramic internal surface was etched with fluoridric acid (5%) + silane followed by cementation according to respective protocols. All samples were mechanically cycled (200N and 4.5x105 Pa, 37°C, 2x106 cycles, 3.4Hz) and submitted to axial compressing fracture load test (10kN, 0.5mm/min). The results(N) were submitted to descriptive and analytical statistical analysis with 1-way ANOVA, Weibull, and the Tukey test (α=0.05). ANOVA revealed that there was a significant difference among the tested groups (p<0.0001). The group Al/MDP presented the higher resistance to fracture (1972.46A N), followed by the Ctr group (1584.41B N). The characteristic strength(σ0) was significantly different (p=0.000). The crack and chipping were the predominant failures. The air-abrasion at the external surface of zirconia with Al2O3 followed by cementation with MDP resin cement, should be selected to Rapid Layer Technique when felspathic ceramic is used as veneer ceramic.",

        "publishedDate": "2018-10-01T16:34:20",
        "content": "This work presents a method to produce structural composites capable of energy storage. They are produced by integrating thin sandwich structures of CNT fiber veils and an ionic liquid-based polymer electrolyte between carbon fiber plies, followed by infusion and curing of an epoxy resin. The resulting structure behaves simultaneously as an electric double-layer capacitor and a structural composite, with flexural modulus of 60 GPa and flexural strength of 153 MPa, combined with 88 mF/g of specific capacitance and the highest power (30 W/kg) and energy (37.5 mWh/kg) densities reported so far for structural supercapacitors. In-situ electrochemical measurements during 4-point bending show that electrochemical performance is retained up to fracture, with minor changes in equivalent series resistance for interleaves under compressive stress. En route to improving interlaminar properties we produce grid-shaped interleaves that enable mechanical interconnection of plies by the stiff epoxy. Synchrotron 3D X-ray tomography analysis of the resulting hierarchical structure confirms the formation of interlaminar epoxy joints. The manuscript discusses encapsulation role of epoxy, demonstrated by charge-discharge measurements of composites immersed in water, a deleterious agent for ionic liquids. Finally, we show different architectures free of current collector and electrical insulators, in which both CNT fiber and CF act as active electrodes.",

        "content": "A 72-year-old patient had a severe sleep apnea syndrome well controlled for many years through CPAP therapy. When switching to a newer device with upgraded functions, therapy completely failed. A video recording performed by the patient's wife showed high frequency mask movements suggesting inability to maintain a therapeutic pressure with high frequency pressure fluctuations, confirmed afterwards during full night polysomnography and in a bench study. CPAP manufacturers may put on the market new devices with supposedly better algorithms that in fact may have escaped serious pre-marketing evaluation and that may jeopardize the efficacy of a well proven treatment. We suggest that better evaluations are necessary before marketing therapeutic devices, and that post-marketing assessment of unanticipated side effects should become the norm.",

In this context, we fabricated and characterized two samples using different ratios of two easily commercially available materials: epoxy (Stycast 2850FT) and magnetite ($\\mathrm{Fe_{3}O_{4}}$) powder. We performed transmission and reflection measurements from 7 GHz up to 170 GHz with a VNA equipped with a series of standard horn antennas. Using an empirical model we analysed the data to extract complex permittivity and permeability from transmission data; then we used reflection data to validate the results. In this paper we present the sample fabrication procedure, analysis method, parameter extraction pipeline, and results for two samples with different epoxy-powder mass ratios.",

At the microwave frequency, said the X-band, the nanocomposites reveal an unexpected diamagnetism. To explain the intriguing phenomenon, we revisit the Debye relaxation law with the memory effect. The magnetization vector of the magnetite is unable to synchronize with the rapidly changing magnetic field, and it contributes to diamagnetism, a negative magnetic susceptibility for nanoparticles. The model just developed and the fitting result can not only be used to explain the experimental data in the X-band but also can be used to estimate the transition frequency between paramagnetism and diamagnetism.",

        "publishedDate": "2024-01-07T08:41:03",
        "content": "In multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, representing the whole channel only based on partial subchannels will significantly reduce the channel acquisition overhead. For such a channel mapping task, inspired by the intrinsic coupling across the space and frequency domains, this letter proposes to use interleaved learning with partial antenna and subcarrier characteristics to represent the whole MIMO-OFDM channel. Specifically, we design a complex-domain multilayer perceptron (MLP)-Mixer (CMixer), which utilizes two kinds of complex-domain MLP modules to learn the space and frequency characteristics respectively and then interleaves them to couple the learned properties. The complex-domain computation facilitates the learning on the complex-valued channel data, while the interleaving tightens the coupling of space and frequency domains. These two designs jointly reduce the learning burden, making the physics-inspired CMixer more effective on channel representation learning than existing data-driven approaches. Simulation shows that the proposed scheme brings 4.6~10dB gains in mapping accuracy compared to existing schemes under different settings. Besides, ablation studies show the necessity of complex-domain computation as well as the extent to which the interleaved learning matches the channel properties.",

        "content": "The susceptibility to delamination is one of the main concerns in fiber reinforced polymer composites (FRPs). This work demonstrates improvements of 60% in Mode-I fracture toughness after integration of thin (~30 micron), continuous veils of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) directly deposited onto carbon fiber fabric as the CNT are drawn from the gas-phase using a semi-industrial process. A combination of optical imaging, scanning electron microscopy and a Raman spectroscopy provide a new rapid tool to unambiguously determine the crack propagation path by simple visual inspection of fracture surface. The results show that interlaminar crossing between CNT veil/CF interfaces is of paramount importance. The crack front alternatingly propagates above and below the CNT-toughened interlayer, significantly improving the fracture toughness of resultant laminates. This mechanism is strongly influenced by the method used to integrate the veils onto the CF. CNT veils directly deposited onto the fabrics as a low-density layer lead to large improvements in interlaminar properties, whereas compact CNT veils densified by solvent exposure prior to their integration in the lay-up act as defects.",

In situ frequency tuning and impedance matching of the resonator circuit using voltage-tunable capacitors (varactors) is needed to optimize read-out sensitivity, but the performance of conventional semiconductor- and ferroelectric-based varactors degrades substantially in the millikelvin temperature range relevant for solid-state quantum devices. Here we show that strontium titanate and potassium tantalate, materials which can exhibit quantum paraelectric behaviour with large field-tunable permittivity at low temperatures, can be used to make varactors with perfect impedance matching and resonator frequency tuning at 6 mK. We characterize the varactors at 6 mK in terms of their capacitance tunability, dissipative losses and magnetic field insensitivity. We use the quantum paraelectric varactors to optimize the radiofrequency read-out of carbon nanotube quantum dot devices, achieving a charge sensitivity of 4.8 μ",

        "content": "We describe a method for scalable synthesis of epoxy composites with graphene and few-layer graphene fillers, and report on the electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and thermal properties of such composites at elevated temperatures. The tested materials reveal excellent total EMI shielding of ~65 dB (~105 dB) at a thickness of 1 mm(~2 mm) in the X-band frequency range of f=8.2 GHz - 12.4 GHz. The room-temperature cross-plane thermal conductivity of the composite with ~19.5 vol.% of fillers was determined to be ~11.2 W/mK, which is a factor of x41 larger than that of the pristine epoxy. Interestingly, the EMI shielding efficiency improves further as the temperature increases to 520 K while the thermal conductivity remains approximately constant. The excellent EMI shielding and heat conduction characteristics of such multifunctional graphene composites at elevated temperatures are promising for packaging applications of microwave components where EMI shielding and thermal management are important design considerations.",

        "content": "Developing a deep understanding of macroscopic mechanical properties of amorphous systems which lack structural periodicity, has posed a key challenge, not only at the level of theory but also in molecular simulations. Despite significant advancements in computational resources, there is a vast timescale disparity, more than 6 orders of magnitude, between mechanical properties probed in simulations compared to experiments. Using the theoretical framework of non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD), based on the instantaneous normal modes analysis determined through the dynamical matrix of the system, we study the viscoelastic response of a cross-linked epoxy system of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and poly(oxypropylene) diamine, over many orders of magnitude in deformation frequency, below the glass transition temperature. Predictions of the elastic modulus are satisfactorily validated against the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in the high-frequency regime, and against experimental data from dynamic mechanical analysis at frequencies $ \\sim 1 {\\rm Hz}$, hence successfully bridging the timescale gap. The comparison shows that non-affine displacements at the atomic level account for nearly two orders of magnitude reduction in the low-frequency elastic modulus of the polymer glass, compared to affine elasticity estimates. The analysis also reveals the role of internal stresses (as reflected in the instantaneous normal modes), which act as to strengthen the mechanical response.",

        "content": "We fabricated compact low-pass stainless-steel powder filters for use in low-noise measurements at cryogenic temperatures and investigated their attenuation characteristics for different wire lengths, shapes, and preparation methods up to 20 GHz. We used nominally 30-micrometer-sized SUS 304L powder and mixed with Stycast 2850FT by Emerson and Cumming with catalyst 23LV. A 0.1 mm insulated copper wire was wound on preformed powder-mixture spools in the shape of a right-circular cylinder, a flattened elliptic cylinder and a toroid, and the coils were encapsulated in metal tubes or boxes filled with the powder mixture. All the fabricated powder filters showed a large attenuation at high frequencies with a cut-off frequency near 1 GHz. However, the toroidal filter showed prominent ripples corresponding to resonance modes in the 0.5-m-long coil wire. A filter with a 2:1 powder/epoxy mixture mass rate and a wire length of 1.53 m showed an attenuation of -93 dB at 4 GHz and the attenuation was linearly proportional to the wire length. As the powder-to-epoxy ratio increased, the high-frequency attenuation increased. An equally-spaced single-layer coil structure was found to be more efficient in attenuation than a double-layer coil. Geometry of the metal filter-case affected noise ripples with the least noise in a circular-tube case.",

        "content": "In this letter, we study interleave frequency division multiplexing (IFDM) for multicarrier modulation in static multipath and mobile time-varying channels, which outperforms orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) by considering practical advanced detectors. The fundamental principle underlying existing modulation techniques is to establish sparse equivalent channel matrices in order to facilitate the design of low-complexity detection algorithms for signal recovery, making a trade-off between performance and implementation complexity. In contrast, the proposed IFDM establishes an equivalent fully dense and right-unitarily invariant channel matrix with the goal of achieving channel capacity, ensuring that the signals undergo sufficient statistical channel fading. Meanwhile, a low-complexity and replica maximum a posteriori (MAP)-optimal cross-domain memory approximate message passing (CD-MAMP) detector is proposed for IFDM by exploiting the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the unitary invariance in interleave-frequency-domain channel. Numerical results show that IFDM with extremely low-complexity CD-MAMP outperforms OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM with state-of-the-art orthogonal approximate message passing detectors, particularly at low velocities.",

        "content": "Composites of direct-spun carbon nanotube (CNT) mats and epoxy are manufactured and tested in order to determine their mechanical and electrical properties. The mats are spun directly from a floating catalyst, chemical vapour deposition reactor. The volume fraction of epoxy is varied widely by suitable dilution of the epoxy resin with acetone. Subsequent evaporation of the acetone, followed by a cure cycle, leads to composites of varying volume fraction of CNT, epoxy and air. The modulus, strength, electrical conductivity and piezoresistivity of the composites are measured. The CNT mats and their composites exhibit an elastic-plastic stress-strain response under uniaxial tensile loading, and the degree of anisotropy is assessed by testing specimens in 0{\\deg}, 45{\\deg} and 90{\\deg} directions with respect to the draw direction of mat manufacture. The electrical conductivity scales linearly with CNT volume fraction, irrespective of epoxy volume fraction. In contrast, the modulus and strength depend upon both CNT and epoxy volume fractions in a non-linear manner. The macroscopic moduli of the CNT mat-epoxy composites are far below the Voigt bound based on the modulus of CNT walls and epoxy. A micromechanical model is proposed to relate the macroscopic modulus and yield strength of a CNT mat-epoxy composite to the microstructure.",

        "content": "A 72-year-old patient had a severe sleep apnea syndrome well controlled for many years through CPAP therapy. When switching to a newer device with upgraded functions, therapy completely failed. A video recording performed by the patient's wife showed high frequency mask movements suggesting inability to maintain a therapeutic pressure with high frequency pressure fluctuations, confirmed afterwards during full night polysomnography and in a bench study. CPAP manufacturers may put on the market new devices with supposedly better algorithms that in fact may have escaped serious pre-marketing evaluation and that may jeopardize the efficacy of a well proven treatment. We suggest that better evaluations are necessary before marketing therapeutic devices, and that post-marketing assessment of unanticipated side effects should become the norm.",

        "content": "Radiofrequency reflectometry can provide fast and sensitive electrical read-out of charge and spin qubits in quantum dot devices coupled to resonant circuits. In situ frequency tuning and impedance matching of the resonator circuit using voltage-tunable capacitors (varactors) is needed to optimize read-out sensitivity, but the performance of conventional semiconductor- and ferroelectric-based varactors degrades substantially in the millikelvin temperature range relevant for solid-state quantum devices. Here we show that strontium titanate and potassium tantalate, materials which can exhibit quantum paraelectric behaviour with large field-tunable permittivity at low temperatures, can be used to make varactors with perfect impedance matching and resonator frequency tuning at 6 mK. We characterize the varactors at 6 mK in terms of their capacitance tunability, dissipative losses and magnetic field insensitivity. We use the quantum paraelectric varactors to optimize the radiofrequency read-out of carbon nanotube quantum dot devices, achieving a charge sensitivity of 4.8 μ",

When switching to a newer device with upgraded functions, therapy completely failed. A video recording performed by the patient's wife showed high frequency mask movements suggesting inability to maintain a therapeutic pressure with high frequency pressure fluctuations, confirmed afterwards during full night polysomnography and in a bench study. CPAP manufacturers may put on the market new devices with supposedly better algorithms that in fact may have escaped serious pre-marketing evaluation and that may jeopardize the efficacy of a well proven treatment. We suggest that better evaluations are necessary before marketing therapeutic devices, and that post-marketing assessment of unanticipated side effects should become the norm.",

In this context, we fabricated and characterized two samples using different ratios of two easily commercially available materials: epoxy (Stycast 2850FT) and magnetite ($\\mathrm{Fe_{3}O_{4}}$) powder. We performed transmission and reflection measurements from 7 GHz up to 170 GHz with a VNA equipped with a series of standard horn antennas. Using an empirical model we analysed the data to extract complex permittivity and permeability from transmission data; then we used reflection data to validate the results. In this paper we present the sample fabrication procedure, analysis method, parameter extraction pipeline, and results for two samples with different epoxy-powder mass ratios.",

At the microwave frequency, said the X-band, the nanocomposites reveal an unexpected diamagnetism. To explain the intriguing phenomenon, we revisit the Debye relaxation law with the memory effect. The magnetization vector of the magnetite is unable to synchronize with the rapidly changing magnetic field, and it contributes to diamagnetism, a negative magnetic susceptibility for nanoparticles. The model just developed and the fitting result can not only be used to explain the experimental data in the X-band but also can be used to estimate the transition frequency between paramagnetism and diamagnetism.",

        "content": "We describe a method for scalable synthesis of epoxy composites with graphene and few-layer graphene fillers, and report on the electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and thermal properties of such composites at elevated temperatures. The tested materials reveal excellent total EMI shielding of ~65 dB (~105 dB) at a thickness of 1 mm(~2 mm) in the X-band frequency range of f=8.2 GHz - 12.4 GHz. The room-temperature cross-plane thermal conductivity of the composite with ~19.5 vol.% of fillers was determined to be ~11.2 W/mK, which is a factor of x41 larger than that of the pristine epoxy. Interestingly, the EMI shielding efficiency improves further as the temperature increases to 520 K while the thermal conductivity remains approximately constant. The excellent EMI shielding and heat conduction characteristics of such multifunctional graphene composites at elevated temperatures are promising for packaging applications of microwave components where EMI shielding and thermal management are important design considerations.",

        "content": "Developing a deep understanding of macroscopic mechanical properties of amorphous systems which lack structural periodicity, has posed a key challenge, not only at the level of theory but also in molecular simulations. Despite significant advancements in computational resources, there is a vast timescale disparity, more than 6 orders of magnitude, between mechanical properties probed in simulations compared to experiments. Using the theoretical framework of non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD), based on the instantaneous normal modes analysis determined through the dynamical matrix of the system, we study the viscoelastic response of a cross-linked epoxy system of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and poly(oxypropylene) diamine, over many orders of magnitude in deformation frequency, below the glass transition temperature. Predictions of the elastic modulus are satisfactorily validated against the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in the high-frequency regime, and against experimental data from dynamic mechanical analysis at frequencies $ \\sim 1 {\\rm Hz}$, hence successfully bridging the timescale gap. The comparison shows that non-affine displacements at the atomic level account for nearly two orders of magnitude reduction in the low-frequency elastic modulus of the polymer glass, compared to affine elasticity estimates. The analysis also reveals the role of internal stresses (as reflected in the instantaneous normal modes), which act as to strengthen the mechanical response.",

In situ frequency tuning and impedance matching of the resonator circuit using voltage-tunable capacitors (varactors) is needed to optimize read-out sensitivity, but the performance of conventional semiconductor- and ferroelectric-based varactors degrades substantially in the millikelvin temperature range relevant for solid-state quantum devices. Here we show that strontium titanate and potassium tantalate, materials which can exhibit quantum paraelectric behaviour with large field-tunable permittivity at low temperatures, can be used to make varactors with perfect impedance matching and resonator frequency tuning at 6 mK. We characterize the varactors at 6 mK in terms of their capacitance tunability, dissipative losses and magnetic field insensitivity. We use the quantum paraelectric varactors to optimize the radiofrequency read-out of carbon nanotube quantum dot devices, achieving a charge sensitivity of 4.8 μ",

        "content": "We fabricated compact low-pass stainless-steel powder filters for use in low-noise measurements at cryogenic temperatures and investigated their attenuation characteristics for different wire lengths, shapes, and preparation methods up to 20 GHz. We used nominally 30-micrometer-sized SUS 304L powder and mixed with Stycast 2850FT by Emerson and Cumming with catalyst 23LV. A 0.1 mm insulated copper wire was wound on preformed powder-mixture spools in the shape of a right-circular cylinder, a flattened elliptic cylinder and a toroid, and the coils were encapsulated in metal tubes or boxes filled with the powder mixture. All the fabricated powder filters showed a large attenuation at high frequencies with a cut-off frequency near 1 GHz. However, the toroidal filter showed prominent ripples corresponding to resonance modes in the 0.5-m-long coil wire. A filter with a 2:1 powder/epoxy mixture mass rate and a wire length of 1.53 m showed an attenuation of -93 dB at 4 GHz and the attenuation was linearly proportional to the wire length. As the powder-to-epoxy ratio increased, the high-frequency attenuation increased. An equally-spaced single-layer coil structure was found to be more efficient in attenuation than a double-layer coil. Geometry of the metal filter-case affected noise ripples with the least noise in a circular-tube case.",

        "content": "Composites of direct-spun carbon nanotube (CNT) mats and epoxy are manufactured and tested in order to determine their mechanical and electrical properties. The mats are spun directly from a floating catalyst, chemical vapour deposition reactor. The volume fraction of epoxy is varied widely by suitable dilution of the epoxy resin with acetone. Subsequent evaporation of the acetone, followed by a cure cycle, leads to composites of varying volume fraction of CNT, epoxy and air. The modulus, strength, electrical conductivity and piezoresistivity of the composites are measured. The CNT mats and their composites exhibit an elastic-plastic stress-strain response under uniaxial tensile loading, and the degree of anisotropy is assessed by testing specimens in 0{\\deg}, 45{\\deg} and 90{\\deg} directions with respect to the draw direction of mat manufacture. The electrical conductivity scales linearly with CNT volume fraction, irrespective of epoxy volume fraction. In contrast, the modulus and strength depend upon both CNT and epoxy volume fractions in a non-linear manner. The macroscopic moduli of the CNT mat-epoxy composites are far below the Voigt bound based on the modulus of CNT walls and epoxy. A micromechanical model is proposed to relate the macroscopic modulus and yield strength of a CNT mat-epoxy composite to the microstructure.",

        "content": "Epoxy polymers are used in wide range of applications. The properties and performance of epoxy polymers depend upon various factors like the type of constituents and their proportions used and other process parameters. The conventional way of developing epoxy polymers is usually labor-intensive and may not be fully efficient, which has resulted in epoxy polymers having a limited performance range due to the use of predetermined blend combinations, compositions and development parameters. Hence, in order to experiment with more design parameters, robust and easy computational techniques need to be established. To this end, we developed and analyzed in this study a new machine learning (ML) based approach to predict the mechanical properties of epoxy polymers based on their basic structural features. The results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to derive the ML model. The salient feature of our work is that for the development of epoxy polymers based on EPON-862, several new hardeners were explored in addition to the conventionally used ones. The influence of additional parameters like the proportion of curing agent used and the extent of curing on the mechanical properties of epoxy polymers were also investigated. This method can be further extended by providing the epoxy polymer with the desired properties through knowledge of the structural characteristics of its constituents. The findings of our study can thus lead toward development of efficient design methodologies for epoxy polymeric systems.",

        "content": "Our paper presents the design of a unique annular ring-shaped planar monopole antenna with octal geometry intended for a broad spectrum of frequency applications. Utilizing FR4 epoxy for the substrate and copper material for the top patch, the antenna measures 39 mm $\\times$ 30 mm $\\times$ 1.6 mm. It exhibits resonance at 6.8 GHz, with a return loss of -49.01 dB. The antenna demonstrates a broad frequency range from 2.1 GHz - 13.1 GHz, resulting in an overall -10 dB bandwidth of 11 GHz. At the resonating frequency of 6.8 GHz, the antenna accomplished a total gain of 3.01 dBi and a peak gain of 5.87 dBi at 12.4 GHz. Additionally, it attains a high radiation efficiency of 95.26\\%. The annular patch of the antenna helps distribute the current uniformly at the boundaries of the patch. This helps achieve better current distribution and wider -10 dB bandwidth. This antenna is a versatile replacement for multiple antennas catering to various frequency bands.",

        "content": "We demonstrate that polymer composites with a low loading of graphene, below 1.2 wt. %, are efficient as electromagnetic absorbers in the THz frequency range. The epoxy-based graphene composites were tested at frequencies from 0.25 THz to 4 THz, revealing total shielding effectiveness of 85 dB (1 mm thickness) with graphene loading of 1.2 wt. % at the frequency f=1.6 THz. The THz radiation is mostly blocked by absorption rather than reflection. The efficiency of the THz radiation shielding by the lightweight, electrically insulating composites, increases with increasing frequency. Our results suggest that even the thin-film or spray coatings of graphene composites with thickness in the few-hundred-micrometer range can be sufficient for blocking THz radiation in many practical applications.",

In our experiments, small particles of the potassium ferrocyanide with a 1.25 micron mean size played a role of granules. This compound was enriched by $^{57}$Fe isotope. Particle vibrations in the vibrated resin with the frequency 12.72 MHz were induced by piezo polymer film. At rest, M\\\"{o}ssbauer spectrum of $^{57}$Fe in the potassium ferrocyanide consists of a single line. Ultrasonic vibration of nuclei splits the line into a comb structure with a period equal to the vibration frequency. The spectrum analysis allows to estimate the vibration amplitude of particles and decay of the ultrasound in this medium. The proposed method is unique since it allows to measure subangstrom displacements of particles vibrating with several MHz frequency.",

        "content": "Nowadays, convectional metallic material replaced by composite materials, because composite materials have superior than metallic materials properties such as light weights, higher strength-to-weight ratio, high tensile strength, Low cost, greater design flexibility, better fatigue resistance, renewability, and biodegradability. These properties of composite material are the most basic & common attractive features that make them useful for industrial applications. The main objective of this work is to contribute for a better understanding of the static behavior of structure made from fiber reinforced composite materials, specifically for the case of plate structures. The plate model is created using SOLIDWORKS 2017 and then imported into ANSYS R18.1. The study specifically examines three stacking sequences of the composite plate (angle ply, cross ply, and multidirectional ply) to analysis stress and deformation resulted from the loads. The static analysis of a Carbon/Epoxy with honeycomb plate composite reveals that the equivalent stress and deformation are lower in the cross-ply stacking sequence compared to the angle ply and multidirectional ply for the same load carrying capacity. This suggests that the composite plate with a cross ply configuration is more suitable for manufacturing composite structures due to its improved performance.",

        "publishedDate": "2018-10-01T16:34:20",
        "content": "This work presents a method to produce structural composites capable of energy storage. They are produced by integrating thin sandwich structures of CNT fiber veils and an ionic liquid-based polymer electrolyte between carbon fiber plies, followed by infusion and curing of an epoxy resin. The resulting structure behaves simultaneously as an electric double-layer capacitor and a structural composite, with flexural modulus of 60 GPa and flexural strength of 153 MPa, combined with 88 mF/g of specific capacitance and the highest power (30 W/kg) and energy (37.5 mWh/kg) densities reported so far for structural supercapacitors. In-situ electrochemical measurements during 4-point bending show that electrochemical performance is retained up to fracture, with minor changes in equivalent series resistance for interleaves under compressive stress. En route to improving interlaminar properties we produce grid-shaped interleaves that enable mechanical interconnection of plies by the stiff epoxy. Synchrotron 3D X-ray tomography analysis of the resulting hierarchical structure confirms the formation of interlaminar epoxy joints. The manuscript discusses encapsulation role of epoxy, demonstrated by charge-discharge measurements of composites immersed in water, a deleterious agent for ionic liquids. Finally, we show different architectures free of current collector and electrical insulators, in which both CNT fiber and CF act as active electrodes.",

        "content": "Understanding the previous protection and restoration efforts and the current state of cultural relics is essential before compiling a conservation and restoration plan. The lack of detailed archival records for some early conservation operations, the identification of restoration materials necessitates the use of scientific analytical methods. In this study, the composition and spatial distribution of historical restoration materials on five iron relics were investigated through pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and ultraviolet-induced visible luminescence imaging (UVL). The relics studied were iron weight 20791, iron adze head 2335, and iron axe 2334 from the Gansu Provincial Museum, iron sword D0008 from the Zhaotong Municipal Museum, and iron sword 450 from the National Museum of China. All five relics had undergone restoration without accompanying archival records. UVL revealed the distribution of various conservation materials. Notably, two distinct layers of the conservation material were observed on iron axe 2334. Differences in the fluorescence color and intensity of iron sword 450 provided information regarding the sampling strategy. The samples were collected under ultraviolet light emitting diode illumination to ensure representativeness and minimize damage to the relics. Through Py-GC/MS, the coating materials for iron weight 20791 and iron adze head 2335 were identified as boiled tung oil mixed with rosin resin. Iron axis 2334 had a two-layer coating: a base layer of boiled tung oil and a top layer of shellac. The coating material for iron sword D0008 was determined to be paraffin wax. The protective layer of iron sword 450 included multiple materials, including shellac, polystyrene, and bisphenol-A-type epoxy resin. This study confirms that UVL combined with Py-GC/MS serves as an effective technique for analyzing historical restoration materials. UVL guided the selection of representative samples for Py-GC/MS, reducing the time and amount of sampling required and minimizing further damage to the relics. This research provides valuable data for the restoration archives of five iron artifacts, offering a scientific basis for conservators to evaluate conservation methods, devise future conservation strategies, and exclude ineffective conservation materials.",

        "content": "The susceptibility to delamination is one of the main concerns in fiber reinforced polymer composites (FRPs). This work demonstrates improvements of 60% in Mode-I fracture toughness after integration of thin (~30 micron), continuous veils of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) directly deposited onto carbon fiber fabric as the CNT are drawn from the gas-phase using a semi-industrial process. A combination of optical imaging, scanning electron microscopy and a Raman spectroscopy provide a new rapid tool to unambiguously determine the crack propagation path by simple visual inspection of fracture surface. The results show that interlaminar crossing between CNT veil/CF interfaces is of paramount importance. The crack front alternatingly propagates above and below the CNT-toughened interlayer, significantly improving the fracture toughness of resultant laminates. This mechanism is strongly influenced by the method used to integrate the veils onto the CF. CNT veils directly deposited onto the fabrics as a low-density layer lead to large improvements in interlaminar properties, whereas compact CNT veils densified by solvent exposure prior to their integration in the lay-up act as defects.",

        "content": "Composites of direct-spun carbon nanotube (CNT) mats and epoxy are manufactured and tested in order to determine their mechanical and electrical properties. The mats are spun directly from a floating catalyst, chemical vapour deposition reactor. The volume fraction of epoxy is varied widely by suitable dilution of the epoxy resin with acetone. Subsequent evaporation of the acetone, followed by a cure cycle, leads to composites of varying volume fraction of CNT, epoxy and air. The modulus, strength, electrical conductivity and piezoresistivity of the composites are measured. The CNT mats and their composites exhibit an elastic-plastic stress-strain response under uniaxial tensile loading, and the degree of anisotropy is assessed by testing specimens in 0{\\deg}, 45{\\deg} and 90{\\deg} directions with respect to the draw direction of mat manufacture. The electrical conductivity scales linearly with CNT volume fraction, irrespective of epoxy volume fraction. In contrast, the modulus and strength depend upon both CNT and epoxy volume fractions in a non-linear manner. The macroscopic moduli of the CNT mat-epoxy composites are far below the Voigt bound based on the modulus of CNT walls and epoxy. A micromechanical model is proposed to relate the macroscopic modulus and yield strength of a CNT mat-epoxy composite to the microstructure.",

        "content": "Epoxy polymers are used in wide range of applications. The properties and performance of epoxy polymers depend upon various factors like the type of constituents and their proportions used and other process parameters. The conventional way of developing epoxy polymers is usually labor-intensive and may not be fully efficient, which has resulted in epoxy polymers having a limited performance range due to the use of predetermined blend combinations, compositions and development parameters. Hence, in order to experiment with more design parameters, robust and easy computational techniques need to be established. To this end, we developed and analyzed in this study a new machine learning (ML) based approach to predict the mechanical properties of epoxy polymers based on their basic structural features. The results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to derive the ML model. The salient feature of our work is that for the development of epoxy polymers based on EPON-862, several new hardeners were explored in addition to the conventionally used ones. The influence of additional parameters like the proportion of curing agent used and the extent of curing on the mechanical properties of epoxy polymers were also investigated. This method can be further extended by providing the epoxy polymer with the desired properties through knowledge of the structural characteristics of its constituents. The findings of our study can thus lead toward development of efficient design methodologies for epoxy polymeric systems.",

        "publishedDate": "2022-01-10T18:37:35",
        "content": "In this work, we demonstrate that use of dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent leads to better dispersion of graphene nanoplatelets in epoxy matrix compared to acetone solvent, in turn leading to higher thermal conductivity epoxy-graphene nanocomposites. While role of solvents in enabling superior mechanical properties has been addressed before, outlined study is the first to address the effect of solvents on thermal conductivity enhancement and provides novel pathways for achieving high thermal conductivity polymer composite materials. Uniform dispersion of graphene nanoparticles into epoxy can improve thermal contact with polymer leading to superior interface thermal conductance between polymer matrix and graphene. Organic solvents are typically employed to achieve efficient dispersion of graphene into the epoxy matrix. In this study, we compare the effect of two organic solvents, dimethylformamide (DMF) and acetone, in terms of their efficiency in dispersing graphene into the epoxy matrix and their effect on enhancing thermal conductivity of the composite. We find that polymer-graphene composites made with DMF solvent show 44% higher thermal conductivity compared to those made using acetone at 7 weight% filler composition. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) imaging reveals that graphene-epoxy composites, prepared using DMF as solvent, exhibit more uniform dispersion of graphene-nanoplatelets compared to the case of acetone with acetone-based samples exhibiting up to 211% larger graphene agglomerations. Comparison with effective medium theory reveals an almost 35% lower interface thermal resistance between graphene and epoxy for DMF relative to acetone prepared composite. These results provide fundamentally new avenues to achieve higher thermal conductivity graphene-epoxy composites, of key importance for a wide range of thermal management technologies.",

        "content": "The value of biomaterials for green products has begun to develop more ecofriendly and renewable sustainable materials for a better circular economy and to reduce carbon footprints. This work presents integrated investigations of the lignocellulosic date palm/epoxy composites at various reinforcement condition parameters for sustainable structural materials where elemental mapping, topological analysis, and mechanical performance have been performed. Mapping energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was utilized to assess the composite composition properly. Elemental mapping and a scanning electron microscope were employed to evaluate the chemical composition of the composites. The mechanical performance of the produced composites was also explored in terms of ultimate tensile strength, tensile modulus, elongation at break, and impact energy properties. The effects of fiber loading, fiber length, and fiber width (as long fiber, short fiber, and long-thin fiber) were investigated for the date palm fiber/epoxy composites. Results have revealed that the composite behavior was affected by several influential reinforcement parameters. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy maps by C-K, O-K, Si-K, K-K, and Ca-K demonstrated that the composites contain mainly carbon, silicon, and oxygen. It was evident that the modulus of elasticity property of short fiber composites exhibits an increasing trend with higher fiber content, even at 35 wt%. Moreover, the enhancement of tensile strength for the short fiber size composites reached 72.5 %. However, such tensile strength of thin fiber size/epoxy composites achieved 135.7 % at 25 wt% indicating superior development of this mechanical property. The long date palm fiber composites demonstrated the best value of modulus of elasticity and the maximum impact energy of 15.3 kJ/m",

        "publishedDate": "2021-08-02T14:26:14",
        "content": "Epoxy resins are used extensively in composite materials for a wide range of engineering applications, including structural components of aircraft and spacecraft. The processing of fiber-reinforced epoxy composite structures requires carefully selected heating and cooling cycles to fully cure the resin and form strong crosslinked networks. To fully optimize the processing parameters for effective epoxy monomer crosslinking and final product integrity, the evolution of mechanical properties of epoxies during processing must be comprehensively understood. Because the full experimental characterization of these properties as a function of the degree of cure is difficult and time-consuming, efficient computational predictive tools are needed. The objective of this research is to develop an experimentally validated Molecular Dynamics (MD) modeling method, which incorporates a reactive force field, to accurately predict the thermo-mechanical properties of an epoxy resin as a function of the degree of cure. Experimental rheometric and mechanical testing are used to validate an MD model which is subsequently used to predict mass density, shrinkage, elastic properties, and yield strength as a function of the degree of cure. The results indicate that each of the physical and mechanical properties evolve uniquely during the crosslinking process. These results are important for future processing modeling efforts.",

        "content": "Decoctions of Ferula orientalis L. (Apiaceae), have been traditionally used to lower blood glucose levels (BGLs). After in vitro enzyme inhibition tests on the dichloromethane extracts of the roots (FOD) and the methanol extract of the roots (FOM), isolation studies were carried out on the FOD extract. The anti-hyperglycemic effects of the FOD extract and the pure compounds were studied in mice using the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) models. Molecular docking studies were performed on potent compounds in the binding pockets of enzymes α-glucosidase and α-amylase. The isolations of 11 compounds were isolated from the FOD extract, which comprised teferidine (1), ferutinin (FT) (2), teferin (3), epoxy-jaeschkeanadiol-p-hydroxybenzoate (4), epoxy-jaeschkeanadiol-6-vanillate (5), tovarol-8-angelate (6), leucoferin (7), tovarol-8-p-hydroxybenzoate (8), tovarol-8-vanillate (9), 6-β-p-hydroxybenzoyloxy-germacra-1(10),4-diene (10), and chimgin (11). Compounds 2 and 8-11 exhibited a higher inhibitory activity on α-glucosidase. In the OGTT, pretreatment with the FOD extract or compound 2 did not alter the BGLs after administration of the glucose solution compared to the control. In the STZ-induced diabetic mice model, no significant difference in the BGLs was observed with the FOD extract (200 mg/kg) or compound 2 (100 mg/kg)-treated diabetic mice compared to the diabetic control mice. The experimental studies all showed that the F. orientalis extract had significant effects on the enzyme systems involved in DM, and it would be appropriate to plan further studies on possible problems of bioavailability of the compound FT and the FOD extract, inadequate dose, and duration of administration.",

Sixty epoxy resin preparations simulating a molar tooth were obtained and 60 zirconia infrastructures and feldspathic crowns were manufactured by RLT and divided into 6 groups according to the cementation protocol at the interface to veneering ceramic (n=10): Ctr- control: conventional resin cement; Al- Al2O3 sandblasting 50µm + conventional resin cement; Al/MDP- Al2O3 sandblasting (50µm) + resin cement with MDP; Sil- silicatization 30µm + conventional resin cement; Gl/HF- glaze + hydrofluoridric acid (5%,60s) + silane + conventional resin cement; Gl- glazing as bonding agent. The feldspathic ceramic internal surface was etched with fluoridric acid (5%) + silane followed by cementation according to respective protocols. All samples were mechanically cycled (200N and 4.5x105 Pa, 37°C, 2x106 cycles, 3.4Hz) and submitted to axial compressing fracture load test (10kN, 0.5mm/min). The results(N) were submitted to descriptive and analytical statistical analysis with 1-way ANOVA, Weibull, and the Tukey test (α=0.05). ANOVA revealed that there was a significant difference among the tested groups (p<0.0001). The group Al/MDP presented the higher resistance to fracture (1972.46A N), followed by the Ctr group (1584.41B N). The characteristic strength(σ0) was significantly different (p=0.000). The crack and chipping were the predominant failures. The air-abrasion at the external surface of zirconia with Al2O3 followed by cementation with MDP resin cement, should be selected to Rapid Layer Technique when felspathic ceramic is used as veneer ceramic.",

        "publishedDate": "2017-05-12T09:17:02",
        "content": "We present an analytical study of oscillatory laminar shear flow over a compliant viscoelastic layer on a rigid base. This problem relates to oscillating blood flow in viscoelastic vessels. The deeper motivation for this study, however, is the possible use of compliant coatings for turbulent drag reduction. An analytical solution of the fluid and solid velocity is presented, and five dimensionless parameters emerge. The interaction between fluid and solid appears to be determined by a single combined dimensionless parameter, which we call the shear interaction parameter $\\chi$. The fluid satisfies a no-slip boundary condition when $\\left|\\chi\\right| \\rightarrow 0$, which occurs when the solid is heavy, stiff and/or thin. In contrast, the fluid obeys a free-slip boundary condition when $\\left|\\chi\\right| \\rightarrow \\infty$, which corresponds to a lightweight and/or soft solid. Three types of resonance modes are identified for an elastic solid. Two modes (odd and even) are specific to the solid. The third mode results from the coupling with the fluid. The three modes are less pronounced or even absent for a viscoelastic solid. These findings have a twofold use. First, they help to understand the fluid and solid dynamics when shear coupling is important. Second, the presented analytical solution is very useful for validation of numerical fluid-structure-interaction solvers. Future work might include the extension of the theory to multiple viscoelastic layers and the dynamic coupling of normal stresses.",

When switching to a newer device with upgraded functions, therapy completely failed. A video recording performed by the patient's wife showed high frequency mask movements suggesting inability to maintain a therapeutic pressure with high frequency pressure fluctuations, confirmed afterwards during full night polysomnography and in a bench study. CPAP manufacturers may put on the market new devices with supposedly better algorithms that in fact may have escaped serious pre-marketing evaluation and that may jeopardize the efficacy of a well proven treatment. We suggest that better evaluations are necessary before marketing therapeutic devices, and that post-marketing assessment of unanticipated side effects should become the norm.",

        "content": "Radiofrequency reflectometry can provide fast and sensitive electrical read-out of charge and spin qubits in quantum dot devices coupled to resonant circuits. In situ frequency tuning and impedance matching of the resonator circuit using voltage-tunable capacitors (varactors) is needed to optimize read-out sensitivity, but the performance of conventional semiconductor- and ferroelectric-based varactors degrades substantially in the millikelvin temperature range relevant for solid-state quantum devices. Here we show that strontium titanate and potassium tantalate, materials which can exhibit quantum paraelectric behaviour with large field-tunable permittivity at low temperatures, can be used to make varactors with perfect impedance matching and resonator frequency tuning at 6 mK. We characterize the varactors at 6 mK in terms of their capacitance tunability, dissipative losses and magnetic field insensitivity. We use the quantum paraelectric varactors to optimize the radiofrequency read-out of carbon nanotube quantum dot devices, achieving a charge sensitivity of 4.8 μ",

When switching to a newer device with upgraded functions, therapy completely failed. A video recording performed by the patient's wife showed high frequency mask movements suggesting inability to maintain a therapeutic pressure with high frequency pressure fluctuations, confirmed afterwards during full night polysomnography and in a bench study. CPAP manufacturers may put on the market new devices with supposedly better algorithms that in fact may have escaped serious pre-marketing evaluation and that may jeopardize the efficacy of a well proven treatment. We suggest that better evaluations are necessary before marketing therapeutic devices, and that post-marketing assessment of unanticipated side effects should become the norm.",

        "content": "Radiofrequency reflectometry can provide fast and sensitive electrical read-out of charge and spin qubits in quantum dot devices coupled to resonant circuits. In situ frequency tuning and impedance matching of the resonator circuit using voltage-tunable capacitors (varactors) is needed to optimize read-out sensitivity, but the performance of conventional semiconductor- and ferroelectric-based varactors degrades substantially in the millikelvin temperature range relevant for solid-state quantum devices. Here we show that strontium titanate and potassium tantalate, materials which can exhibit quantum paraelectric behaviour with large field-tunable permittivity at low temperatures, can be used to make varactors with perfect impedance matching and resonator frequency tuning at 6 mK. We characterize the varactors at 6 mK in terms of their capacitance tunability, dissipative losses and magnetic field insensitivity. We use the quantum paraelectric varactors to optimize the radiofrequency read-out of carbon nanotube quantum dot devices, achieving a charge sensitivity of 4.8 μ",

        "content": "A 72-year-old patient had a severe sleep apnea syndrome well controlled for many years through CPAP therapy. When switching to a newer device with upgraded functions, therapy completely failed. A video recording performed by the patient's wife showed high frequency mask movements suggesting inability to maintain a therapeutic pressure with high frequency pressure fluctuations, confirmed afterwards during full night polysomnography and in a bench study. CPAP manufacturers may put on the market new devices with supposedly better algorithms that in fact may have escaped serious pre-marketing evaluation and that may jeopardize the efficacy of a well proven treatment. We suggest that better evaluations are necessary before marketing therapeutic devices, and that post-marketing assessment of unanticipated side effects should become the norm.",

        "content": "Radiofrequency reflectometry can provide fast and sensitive electrical read-out of charge and spin qubits in quantum dot devices coupled to resonant circuits. In situ frequency tuning and impedance matching of the resonator circuit using voltage-tunable capacitors (varactors) is needed to optimize read-out sensitivity, but the performance of conventional semiconductor- and ferroelectric-based varactors degrades substantially in the millikelvin temperature range relevant for solid-state quantum devices. Here we show that strontium titanate and potassium tantalate, materials which can exhibit quantum paraelectric behaviour with large field-tunable permittivity at low temperatures, can be used to make varactors with perfect impedance matching and resonator frequency tuning at 6 mK. We characterize the varactors at 6 mK in terms of their capacitance tunability, dissipative losses and magnetic field insensitivity. We use the quantum paraelectric varactors to optimize the radiofrequency read-out of carbon nanotube quantum dot devices, achieving a charge sensitivity of 4.8 μ",

We explored noradrenaline (NA)'s role in modulating signaling in vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs), responsible for detecting pheromones and other semiochemicals. In current-clamp recordings, NA increased the firing frequency in response to natural stimuli of responsive VSNs and induced spiking activity in previously unresponsive neurons. Current injections into VSNs showed an increase in firing frequency during NA application. Combining transcriptomic analysis, electrophysiology, Ca",

        "content": "A 72-year-old patient had a severe sleep apnea syndrome well controlled for many years through CPAP therapy. When switching to a newer device with upgraded functions, therapy completely failed. A video recording performed by the patient's wife showed high frequency mask movements suggesting inability to maintain a therapeutic pressure with high frequency pressure fluctuations, confirmed afterwards during full night polysomnography and in a bench study. CPAP manufacturers may put on the market new devices with supposedly better algorithms that in fact may have escaped serious pre-marketing evaluation and that may jeopardize the efficacy of a well proven treatment. We suggest that better evaluations are necessary before marketing therapeutic devices, and that post-marketing assessment of unanticipated side effects should become the norm.",

        "title": "Quantum paraelectric varactors for radiofrequency measurements at millikelvin temperatures.",
        "content": "Radiofrequency reflectometry can provide fast and sensitive electrical read-out of charge and spin qubits in quantum dot devices coupled to resonant circuits. In situ frequency tuning and impedance matching of the resonator circuit using voltage-tunable capacitors (varactors) is needed to optimize read-out sensitivity, but the performance of conventional semiconductor- and ferroelectric-based varactors degrades substantially in the millikelvin temperature range relevant for solid-state quantum devices. Here we show that strontium titanate and potassium tantalate, materials which can exhibit quantum paraelectric behaviour with large field-tunable permittivity at low temperatures, can be used to make varactors with perfect impedance matching and resonator frequency tuning at 6 mK. We characterize the varactors at 6 mK in terms of their capacitance tunability, dissipative losses and magnetic field insensitivity. We use the quantum paraelectric varactors to optimize the radiofrequency read-out of carbon nanotube quantum dot devices, achieving a charge sensitivity of 4.8 μ",

In current-clamp recordings, NA increased the firing frequency in response to natural stimuli of responsive VSNs and induced spiking activity in previously unresponsive neurons. Current injections into VSNs showed an increase in firing frequency during NA application. Combining transcriptomic analysis, electrophysiology, Ca",
