Title: Experiments, numerical models and optimization of carbon-epoxy plates damped by a frequency-dependent interleaved viscoelastic layer
URL: https://hal.science/hal-03155700
Snippet: International audience; The research work presented in this paper aims to optimize the dynamic response of a carbon-epoxy plate by including into the laminate one frequency-dependent interleaved viscoelastic layer. To keep an acceptable bending stiffness, some holes are created in the viscoelastic layer, thus facilitating the resin through layer penetration during the co-curing manufacturing process. Plates including (or not) one perforated (or non-perforated) viscoelastic layer are manufactured and investigated experimentally and numerically. First, static and dynamic tests are performed on sandwich coupons to characterize the stiffness and damping properties of the plates in a given frequency range. Resulting mechanical properties are then used to set-up a finite element model and simulate the plate dynamic response. In parallel, frequency response measurements are carried out on the manufactured plates, then successfully confronted to the numerical results. Finally, a design of experiments is built based on a limited number on numerical simulations to find the configuration of bridges that maximizes the damping while keeping a stiffness higher than half the stiffness of the equivalent undamped plate.

Title: Viscoelastic Effects during Tangential Contact Analyzed by a Novel Finite Element Approach with Embedded Interface Profiles
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07886v1
Snippet: A computational approach that is based on interface finite elements with eMbedded Profiles for Joint Roughness (MPJR) is exploited in order to study the viscoelastic contact problems with any complex shape of the indenting profiles. The MPJR finite elements, previously developed for partial slip contact problems, are herein further generalized in order to deal with finite sliding displacements. The approach is applied to a case study concerning a periodic contact problem between a sinusoidal profile and a viscoelastic layer of finite thickness. In particular, the effect of using three different rheological models that are based on Prony series (with one, two, or three arms) to approximate the viscoelastic behaviour of a real polymer is investigated. The method allows for predicting the whole transient regime during the normal contact problem and the subsequent sliding scenario from full stick to full slip, and then up to gross sliding. The effects of the viscoelastic model approximation and of the sliding velocities are carefully investigated. The proposed approach aims at tackling a class of problems that are difficult to address with other methods, which include the possibility of analysing indenters of generic profile, the capability of simulating partial slip and gross slip due to finite slidings, and, finally, the possibility of simultaneously investigating dissipative phenomena, like viscoelastic dissipation and energy losses due to interface friction.

Title: Permittivity and permeability of epoxy–magnetite powder composites at microwave frequencies
URL: http://hdl.handle.net/10281/259088
Snippet: Radio, millimeter, and sub-millimeter astronomy experiments as well as remote sensing applications often require castable absorbers with well known electromagnetic properties to design and realize calibration targets. In this context, we fabricated and characterized two samples using different ratios of two easily commercially available materials: epoxy (Stycast 2850FT) and magnetite (Fe3O4) powder. We performed transmission and reflection measurements from 7 GHz up to 170 GHz with a vector network analyzer equipped with a series of standard horn antennas. Using an empirical model, we analyzed the data to extract complex permittivity and permeability from transmission data; then, we used reflection data to validate the results. In this paper, we present the sample fabrication procedure, analysis method, parameter extraction pipeline, and results for two samples with different epoxy-powder mass ratios.

Title: Frequency dependent heat capacity in the cure of epoxy resins
URL: https://biblio.vub.ac.be/vubir/frequency-dependent-heat-capacity-in-the-cure-of-epoxy-resins(97c1b558-334b-45be-b071-36b58532ef12).html
Snippet: Abstract Different temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry ( TMDSC ) approaches were explored for studying the frequency dependence of the vitrification phenomenon during the cure of a thermosetting epoxy resin. All approaches show the expected decrease in vitrification time with increasing frequency. Light ( heating ) ( temperature ) modulated DSC ( LMDSC ), developed by Saruyama, offers the advantage that the frequency range for direct measurements is extended (from 0.01 to 1 Hz). However, at frequencies above 0.1 Hz, the results contain information about the changing thermal diffusivity (for samples above 100 μm thick). A complex saw-tooth modulation method , developed by Wunderlich, allows multiple frequencies (over almost one decade) to be measured in a single experiment, thus eliminating effects of sample reproducibility. For studying the frequency dependence during (chemical) transformations, such as cure, the desired invariance of the sample during at least one modulation period and thermal diffusivity effects (even for films of only 100 μm thick) limit a further extension of the frequency domain to lower and higher frequencies, respectively.

Title: Interlaminar toughening in structural carbon fiber/epoxy composites interleaved with carbon nanotube veils
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09080v2
Snippet: The susceptibility to delamination is one of the main concerns in fiber reinforced polymer composites (FRPs). This work demonstrates improvements of 60% in Mode-I fracture toughness after integration of thin (~30 micron), continuous veils of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) directly deposited onto carbon fiber fabric as the CNT are drawn from the gas-phase using a semi-industrial process. A combination of optical imaging, scanning electron microscopy and a Raman spectroscopy provide a new rapid tool to unambiguously determine the crack propagation path by simple visual inspection of fracture surface. The results show that interlaminar crossing between CNT veil/CF interfaces is of paramount importance. The crack front alternatingly propagates above and below the CNT-toughened interlayer, significantly improving the fracture toughness of resultant laminates. This mechanism is strongly influenced by the method used to integrate the veils onto the CF. CNT veils directly deposited onto the fabrics as a low-density layer lead to large improvements in interlaminar properties, whereas compact CNT veils densified by solvent exposure prior to their integration in the lay-up act as defects.
