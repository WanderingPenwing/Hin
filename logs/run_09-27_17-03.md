Title: On the conductivity of pure epoxy in time and frequency domain
URL: https://doi.org/10.1109/ceidp.2009.5377887
Snippet: This paper contains examinations concerning the conducting behavior of pure epoxy resin in time and frequency domain First, time resolved current measurements are presented to analyze the behavior in time domain experimentally. The conducting behavior is recorded in dependence of temperature and applied DC-voltage. Based on the experimental examinations an equivalent circuit diagram is developed which offers the possibility to simulate the measured charging and discharging currents and to perform frequency depending examinations in the range significantly lower 1 Hz.

Title: Experiments, numerical models and optimization of carbon-epoxy plates damped by a frequency-dependent interleaved viscoelastic layer
URL: https://hal.science/hal-03155700
Snippet: International audience; The research work presented in this paper aims to optimize the dynamic response of a carbon-epoxy plate by including into the laminate one frequency-dependent interleaved viscoelastic layer. To keep an acceptable bending stiffness, some holes are created in the viscoelastic layer, thus facilitating the resin through layer penetration during the co-curing manufacturing process. Plates including (or not) one perforated (or non-perforated) viscoelastic layer are manufactured and investigated experimentally and numerically. First, static and dynamic tests are performed on sandwich coupons to characterize the stiffness and damping properties of the plates in a given frequency range. Resulting mechanical properties are then used to set-up a finite element model and simulate the plate dynamic response. In parallel, frequency response measurements are carried out on the manufactured plates, then successfully confronted to the numerical results. Finally, a design of experiments is built based on a limited number on numerical simulations to find the configuration of bridges that maximizes the damping while keeping a stiffness higher than half the stiffness of the equivalent undamped plate.

Title: Analysis of MWCNT/epoxy composites at microwave frequency: reproducibility investigation
URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/1556-276x-9-168
Snippet: A wide-band microwave characterization of nanocomposites based on commercial multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and epoxy resin is presented. The sample preparation method is discussed in detail. Field emission scanning electron microscopy is used for morphological sample analysis of nanocomposites and MWCNTs. The complex permittivity is measured in a wide frequency band (3 to 18 GHz) using a commercial dielectric probe (Agilent 85070D) and a network analyzer (E8361A). A statistical analysis based on one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique is performed. The aim of this statistical analysis is to investigate the influence of concentration of nanoparticles inside the polymer matrix on the complex permittivity. This can be significantly different in nanocomposites even if the samples have similar electrical properties.

Title: Frequency dependent heat capacity in the cure of epoxy resins
URL: https://biblio.vub.ac.be/vubir/frequency-dependent-heat-capacity-in-the-cure-of-epoxy-resins(97c1b558-334b-45be-b071-36b58532ef12).html
Snippet: Abstract Different temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry ( TMDSC ) approaches were explored for studying the frequency dependence of the vitrification phenomenon during the cure of a thermosetting epoxy resin. All approaches show the expected decrease in vitrification time with increasing frequency. Light ( heating ) ( temperature ) modulated DSC ( LMDSC ), developed by Saruyama, offers the advantage that the frequency range for direct measurements is extended (from 0.01 to 1 Hz). However, at frequencies above 0.1 Hz, the results contain information about the changing thermal diffusivity (for samples above 100 μm thick). A complex saw-tooth modulation method , developed by Wunderlich, allows multiple frequencies (over almost one decade) to be measured in a single experiment, thus eliminating effects of sample reproducibility. For studying the frequency dependence during (chemical) transformations, such as cure, the desired invariance of the sample during at least one modulation period and thermal diffusivity effects (even for films of only 100 μm thick) limit a further extension of the frequency domain to lower and higher frequencies, respectively.
