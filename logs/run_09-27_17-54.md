Title: Extended plane wave expansion formulation for viscoelastic phononic thin plates
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14916v1
Snippet: The extended plane wave expansion (EPWE) formulation is derived to obtain the complex band structure of flexural waves in viscoelastic thin phononic crystal plates considering the Kirchhoff-Love plate theory. The presented formulation yields the evanescent behavior of flexural waves in periodic thin plates considering viscoelastic effects. The viscosity is modeled by the standard linear solid model (SLSM), typically used to closely model the behavior of polymers. It is observed that the viscoelasticity influences significantly both the propagating and evanescent Bloch modes. The highest wave attenuation of the viscoelastic phononic thin plate is found around a unit cell filling fraction of 0.37 for higher frequencies considering the least attenuated wave mode. This EPWE formulation broadens the suitable methods to handle evanescent flexural waves in 2-D thin periodic plate systems considering the effects of viscoelasticity on wave attenuation.

Title: Derivation of von Kármán plate theory in the framework of three-dimensional viscoelasticity
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10037v4
Snippet: We apply a quasistatic nonlinear model for nonsimple viscoelastic materials at a finite-strain setting in the Kelvin's-Voigt's rheology to derive a viscoelastic plate model of von K\'arm\'an type. We start from time-discrete solutions to a model of three-dimensional viscoelasticity where the viscosity stress tensor complies with the principle of time-continuous frame-indifference. Combining the derivation of nonlinear plate theory by Friesecke, James and M\"{u}ller, and the abstract theory of gradient flows in metric spaces by Sandier and Serfaty we perform a dimension-reduction from 3D to 2D and identify weak solutions of viscoelastic form of von K\'arm\'an plates.

Title: Stabilization for vibrating plate with singular structural damping
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13089v1
Snippet: We consider the dynamic elasticity equation, modeled by the Euler-Bernoulli plate equation, with a locally distributed singular structural (or viscoelastic ) damping in a boundary domain. Using a frequency domain method combined, based on the Burq's result, combined with an estimate of Carleman type we provide precise decay estimate showing that the energy of the system decays logarithmically as the type goes to the infinity.

Title: Experiments, numerical models and optimization of carbon-epoxy plates damped by a frequency-dependent interleaved viscoelastic layer
URL: https://hal.science/hal-03155700
Snippet: International audience; The research work presented in this paper aims to optimize the dynamic response of a carbon-epoxy plate by including into the laminate one frequency-dependent interleaved viscoelastic layer. To keep an acceptable bending stiffness, some holes are created in the viscoelastic layer, thus facilitating the resin through layer penetration during the co-curing manufacturing process. Plates including (or not) one perforated (or non-perforated) viscoelastic layer are manufactured and investigated experimentally and numerically. First, static and dynamic tests are performed on sandwich coupons to characterize the stiffness and damping properties of the plates in a given frequency range. Resulting mechanical properties are then used to set-up a finite element model and simulate the plate dynamic response. In parallel, frequency response measurements are carried out on the manufactured plates, then successfully confronted to the numerical results. Finally, a design of experiments is built based on a limited number on numerical simulations to find the configuration of bridges that maximizes the damping while keeping a stiffness higher than half the stiffness of the equivalent undamped plate.

Title: Viscoelastic Effects during Tangential Contact Analyzed by a Novel Finite Element Approach with Embedded Interface Profiles
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07886v1
Snippet: A computational approach that is based on interface finite elements with eMbedded Profiles for Joint Roughness (MPJR) is exploited in order to study the viscoelastic contact problems with any complex shape of the indenting profiles. The MPJR finite elements, previously developed for partial slip contact problems, are herein further generalized in order to deal with finite sliding displacements. The approach is applied to a case study concerning a periodic contact problem between a sinusoidal profile and a viscoelastic layer of finite thickness. In particular, the effect of using three different rheological models that are based on Prony series (with one, two, or three arms) to approximate the viscoelastic behaviour of a real polymer is investigated. The method allows for predicting the whole transient regime during the normal contact problem and the subsequent sliding scenario from full stick to full slip, and then up to gross sliding. The effects of the viscoelastic model approximation and of the sliding velocities are carefully investigated. The proposed approach aims at tackling a class of problems that are difficult to address with other methods, which include the possibility of analysing indenters of generic profile, the capability of simulating partial slip and gross slip due to finite slidings, and, finally, the possibility of simultaneously investigating dissipative phenomena, like viscoelastic dissipation and energy losses due to interface friction.

Title: Controllability of a viscoelastic plate using one boundary control in displacement or bending
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02240v1
Snippet: In this paper we consider a viscoelastic plate (linear viscoelasticity of the Maxwell-Boltzmann type) and we compare its controllability properties with the (known) controllability of a purely elastic plate (the control acts on the boundary displacement or bending). By combining operator and moment methods, we prove that the viscoelastic plate inherits the controllability properties of the purely elastic plate.

Title: Impact response of glass/epoxy laminate interleaved with nanofibrous mats
URL: https://doi.org/10.5267/j.esm.2013.09.002
Snippet: Plain and nanofiber-interleaved glass/epoxy laminates clamped according to ASTM D7136 tested under impact loading to assess the improvement in impact resistance of composite laminates that have been interleaved by electrospun polyvinylidene ?uoride (PVDF) nanofibers with two different thicknesses. Composite specimens with stacking sequence [0/90/0/90]S were impacted at impact energy of 5J. Variation of the impact characteristics such as maximum contact load, maximum de?ection, maximum contact time, absorbed energy are depicted in the ?gures. The results showed that PVDF nanofibers are not a good choice for toughening epoxy and improving impact damage resistance of GFRP.
