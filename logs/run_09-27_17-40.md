Title: Experiments, numerical models and optimization of carbon-epoxy plates damped by a frequency-dependent interleaved viscoelastic layer
URL: https://hal.science/hal-03155700
Snippet: International audience; The research work presented in this paper aims to optimize the dynamic response of a carbon-epoxy plate by including into the laminate one frequency-dependent interleaved viscoelastic layer. To keep an acceptable bending stiffness, some holes are created in the viscoelastic layer, thus facilitating the resin through layer penetration during the co-curing manufacturing process. Plates including (or not) one perforated (or non-perforated) viscoelastic layer are manufactured and investigated experimentally and numerically. First, static and dynamic tests are performed on sandwich coupons to characterize the stiffness and damping properties of the plates in a given frequency range. Resulting mechanical properties are then used to set-up a finite element model and simulate the plate dynamic response. In parallel, frequency response measurements are carried out on the manufactured plates, then successfully confronted to the numerical results. Finally, a design of experiments is built based on a limited number on numerical simulations to find the configuration of bridges that maximizes the damping while keeping a stiffness higher than half the stiffness of the equivalent undamped plate.

Title: Viscoelastic Effects during Tangential Contact Analyzed by a Novel Finite Element Approach with Embedded Interface Profiles
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07886v1
Snippet: A computational approach that is based on interface finite elements with eMbedded Profiles for Joint Roughness (MPJR) is exploited in order to study the viscoelastic contact problems with any complex shape of the indenting profiles. The MPJR finite elements, previously developed for partial slip contact problems, are herein further generalized in order to deal with finite sliding displacements. The approach is applied to a case study concerning a periodic contact problem between a sinusoidal profile and a viscoelastic layer of finite thickness. In particular, the effect of using three different rheological models that are based on Prony series (with one, two, or three arms) to approximate the viscoelastic behaviour of a real polymer is investigated. The method allows for predicting the whole transient regime during the normal contact problem and the subsequent sliding scenario from full stick to full slip, and then up to gross sliding. The effects of the viscoelastic model approximation and of the sliding velocities are carefully investigated. The proposed approach aims at tackling a class of problems that are difficult to address with other methods, which include the possibility of analysing indenters of generic profile, the capability of simulating partial slip and gross slip due to finite slidings, and, finally, the possibility of simultaneously investigating dissipative phenomena, like viscoelastic dissipation and energy losses due to interface friction.

Title: Effect of interleaving on the impact response of a unidirectional carbon/epoxy composite
URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-4361(95)91385-i
Snippet: Abstract Instrumented drop-weight impact response of a unidirectional carbon/epoxy composite and that of the corresponding laminate interleaved with poly(ethylene-co-acrylic acid) at the midplane were studied. The impact penetration energy of the unidirectional composite beam increased strongly upon interleaving. Realtime observations using a microscope in a static flexure test indicated a dramatic change of failure mode from the dominantly compressive fracture of the baseline laminate to the dominantly tensile fracture process upon interleaving, in accordance with the corresponding fractographic features of the impact specimens. These observations were attributed to the change in stress distribution upon introduction of the interleaf layer. The relevance of the present observations to the role of high-strain, low-modulus adhesive layers in the toughening of composites is discussed.

Title: Viscoelastic amplification of the pull-off stress in the detachment of a rigid flat punch from an adhesive soft viscoelastic layer
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07597v2
Snippet: The problem of the detachment of a sufficiently large flat indenter from a plane adhesive viscoelastic strip of thickness "b" is studied. For any given retraction speed, three different detachment regimes are found: (i) for very small "b" the detachment stress is constant and equal to the theoretical strength of the interface, (ii) for intermediate values of "b" the detachment stress decays approximately as b^(-1/2), (iii) for thick layers a constant detachment stress is obtained corresponding to case the punch is detaching from a halfplane. By using the boundary element method a comprehensive numerical study is performed which assumes a linear viscoelastic material with a single relaxation time and a Lennard-Jones force-separation law. Pull-off stress is found to consistently and monotonically increase with unloading rate, but to be almost insensitive to the history of the contact. Due to viscoelasticity, unloading at high enough retraction velocity may allow punches of macroscopic size to reach the theoretical strength of the interface. Finally, a corrective term in Greenwood or Persson theories considering finite size effects is proposed. Theoretical and numerical results are found in very good agreement.

Title: Vibration Damping of Interleaved Carbon Fiber-Epoxy Composite Beams
URL: https://doi.org/10.1177/002199839402801806
Snippet: Vibration-damping behavior of unidirectional and symmetric angle-ply carbon fiber-epoxy laminates as well as their interleaved counterparts with a layer of poly(ethylene-co-acrylic acid) (PEAA) at the mid-plane was examined. The introduction of the PEAA layer significantly improved the damping capability. The effectiveness of interleaving increased with the flexural modulus of the outer layers. In the case of unidirectional laminates, calculations based on a sandwich structure of isotropic layers quantitatively reproduced this trend. In the case of angle-ply laminates, however, the model predicted only part of the improvement experimentally observed. This was explained in terms of the bending of the angle-ply laminates in the transverse direction which would induce additional deformations in the interleaf layer and was not accounted for by the present model.

Title: A Numerical Investigation of Delamination Response of CNT/Epoxy Film Interleaved Composite
URL: https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12094194
Snippet: In this study, numerical modeling through the cohesive zone theory was performed to simulate the end notch flexure (ENF) test with same conditions of the experimental results of previous study that investigated the effect of a carbon nanotube (CNT)/epoxy film in carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite through the mode II interlaminar fracture toughness of a non-interleaved, epoxy film interleaved, CNT/epoxy film interleaved CFRP laminate specimen. The effect of the presence of CNT/epoxy film interleave on a composite laminate was modeled. The influence of the interleave cohesive parameters was studied to link the parameters to the material strength and energy release rate. Cohesive parameter identification was performed by matching the initial loading and the damage evolution phase by dividing the cohesive zones into cohesive front and remaining cohesive zones. This is because, when modeling with a single cohesive zone, the critical load point that causes delamination or the curve after load drop do not match the experimental values. Results showed that the divided cohesive zone model is in good agreement with the experimental results and that there is a clear relationship between the cohesive energy of the interface and CNT/epoxy film parameters.

Title: Controllability of a viscoelastic plate using one boundary control in displacement or bending
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02240v1
Snippet: In this paper we consider a viscoelastic plate (linear viscoelasticity of the Maxwell-Boltzmann type) and we compare its controllability properties with the (known) controllability of a purely elastic plate (the control acts on the boundary displacement or bending). By combining operator and moment methods, we prove that the viscoelastic plate inherits the controllability properties of the purely elastic plate.

Title: Frequency dispersion model of the complex permeability of the epoxy—ferrite composite
URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1097-4628(19971017)66:3<477::aid-app7>3.0.co;2-m
Snippet: The factors that influence the complex permeability of the epoxy—ferrite composite were investigated, and the frequency dispersion behavior model for the complex permeability was proposed. The complex permeability of the composite was measured by an impedance/gain phase analyzer and a network analyzer in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 5 GHz. The permeability of the composite was increased with increasing particle size. The frequency dispersion behavior was found to be dependent on the porosity of the composite at a given particle size and ferrite content. The relaxation curve of the complex permeability became broader and flatter as the porosity increased. The equation proposed in this article coincided with the frequency dispersion behavior of the complex permeability of the composite fairly well. It was also found that the variation of σ and ν had a close relationship with the shape variation of the frequency dispersion curve, and that σ and ν were the parameters related to the porosity, particle size, and particle size distribution. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Extended plane wave expansion formulation for viscoelastic phononic thin plates
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14916v1
Snippet: The extended plane wave expansion (EPWE) formulation is derived to obtain the complex band structure of flexural waves in viscoelastic thin phononic crystal plates considering the Kirchhoff-Love plate theory. The presented formulation yields the evanescent behavior of flexural waves in periodic thin plates considering viscoelastic effects. The viscosity is modeled by the standard linear solid model (SLSM), typically used to closely model the behavior of polymers. It is observed that the viscoelasticity influences significantly both the propagating and evanescent Bloch modes. The highest wave attenuation of the viscoelastic phononic thin plate is found around a unit cell filling fraction of 0.37 for higher frequencies considering the least attenuated wave mode. This EPWE formulation broadens the suitable methods to handle evanescent flexural waves in 2-D thin periodic plate systems considering the effects of viscoelasticity on wave attenuation.

Title: Impact response of glass/epoxy laminate interleaved with nanofibrous mats
URL: https://doi.org/10.5267/j.esm.2013.09.002
Snippet: Plain and nanofiber-interleaved glass/epoxy laminates clamped according to ASTM D7136 tested under impact loading to assess the improvement in impact resistance of composite laminates that have been interleaved by electrospun polyvinylidene ?uoride (PVDF) nanofibers with two different thicknesses. Composite specimens with stacking sequence [0/90/0/90]S were impacted at impact energy of 5J. Variation of the impact characteristics such as maximum contact load, maximum de?ection, maximum contact time, absorbed energy are depicted in the ?gures. The results showed that PVDF nanofibers are not a good choice for toughening epoxy and improving impact damage resistance of GFRP.
